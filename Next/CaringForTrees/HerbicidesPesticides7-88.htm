Most growers will have seen codes like S5 or S7 on chemicals they use daily, BUT few may be aware of the meaning behind these codes.</p>
<p>Toxic substances are classified according to Schedules (or lists) in accordance with the Poisons Regulations in all States. There are 8 such Schedules, with most agricultural chemicals listed in Schedules 5, 6, and 7.</p>

<p>The following is a brief overview of the system, with a few examples of the chemicals that belong to each Schedule.</p>
<p>S1 Substances extremely dangerous to human life. </p>
<p>S2 Substances dangerous to human life if misused or carelessly handled.</p>
<p>S3 Therapeutic substances requiring supervised sales by pharmacists.</p>
<p>S4 Therapeutic	substances restricted to prescription.</p>
<p>S5 Hazardous substances readily available to the public, but which require caution in handling, use and storage. They are considered to be products of low toxicity and must be labeled:</p>
<p>WARNING<br>
KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN</p>

<p>Horticultural products in this Schedule include: Carbaryl, Copper-Sulphate, 2, 4, D, Dicofol (Kolthano), Glyphosate (Roundup), Mancozeb, Motalaxyyl (Rydomil), and Zineb.</p>

<p>S6 Poisonous substances readily available to the public for domestic, agricultural, pastural, horticultural, and veterinary purposes. They are considered to be products of moderate to high toxicity, and must be labeled:</p>
<p>POISON<br>
NOT TO BE TAKEN<br>
KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN<br>
READ SAFETY DIRECTIONS BEFORE OPENING</p>
<p>Horticultural products in this Schedule include:	Acephate (Orthene), Demeton-s-methyl (Metasystox), Diazinon, Endusulfan (Thiodan), and Thiram.</p>

<p>S7 Substances of exceptional danger which require special precautions in manufacture and use. They are considered to be products of high to very high toxicity, and must be labled:</p>
<p>DANGEROUS POISON S7 <br>
NOT TO BE TAKEN<br>
KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN<br>
READ SAFETY DIRECTIONS BEFORE OPENING</p>
<p>Horticultural products in this Schedule include: Aldicarb (Temik), Methamidophos (Nitofol), Methidathion (Supracide), Methyl Bromide, Omethoate (Folimat), and Paraquat (Gramoxone).</p>

<p>S8 Substances considered to be narcotic drugs. It is important that you determine what pest you want to kill, and then choose the least dangerous chemical, capable of doing this. Otherwise you place the safety of you and your employees at risk.</p>

<p><b>REMEMBER<br>
READ THE LABEL, IT MAY SAVE YOUR LIFE.</b>
