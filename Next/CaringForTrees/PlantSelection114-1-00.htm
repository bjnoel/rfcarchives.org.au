					PLANT SELECTION FOR A DRY TROPICS PERMACULTURE / RARE FRUITS BACKYARD GARDEN
			</h3></div>
			
		
			
		<div id="storycontainer">
		<p><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
The original idea of listing what plants Ted and I grow in our backyard occurred in 1993 when we were asked to host a Permaculture Field Day. The focus of that afternoon was to help newcomers (both to Permaculture and to Townsville) to become aware of what plants can be grown in the dry tropics and to also look at how some basic permaculture concepts work in a backyard.</p>

<p>We had 50 people come and so the list was collated with the help of those people. A couple of years later I gave a talk to the Permaculture group and extended the list to include reasons why we had chosen those plants.</p>

<p>In February, the RFC Townsville/Thuringowa group combined with the Permaculture group of Townsville to re-visit our back yard as many people were keen to see how the yard had developed/changed.</p>

<p><b>RE-LANDSCAPED PLANTS - and reasons:</b></p>
<div class="bg">Mango - died from waterlogging - also we get given lots so why waste space?</div>
<div class="bg">Pitomba - died from waterlogging</div>
<div class="bg">Ceylon Hill Gooseberry - died- too shady </div>
<div class="bg">Manilla sweet Bean - only one use and didn't fruit much and had prickles</div>
<div class="bg">Barbados cherry - too big, had prickly stems and only I liked it</div>
<div class="bg">Chinese Date- died - waterlogging </div>
<div class="bg">Illama - poor bearer</div>
<div class="bg">Granadilla - was shaded out by neem tree</div>

<p><b>NOTE:</b><br>
Those plants that are marked with an asterisk in a list were initially planted but are no longer in the yard.</p>
<p>Plants on these lists are only the ones that we have grown and used. There are any number of fruit trees that we have not mentioned that would be suitable to grow in the dry tropics without too much TLC.</p>
