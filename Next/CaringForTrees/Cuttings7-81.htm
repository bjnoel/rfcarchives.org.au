<p>
Propagation by cuttings entails obtaining a branch off a plant and keeping it alive long enough for it to form its own root system and so another plant.</p>

<p>Cuttings should only be taken from healthy parent plants in active growth. Guidelines for when and what type of cuttings are: spring or summer; and the older hardwood, although in some cases soft  wood does better.</p>

<p>The length of the cutting is not important, but the cutting must have at least one bud that can be left above the rooting media for eventual shoot development.</p>

<p>The cuttings should be kept from drying out by wrapping in wet paper or placing in a plastic bag out of the sun. Most cuttings will last a few days but the sooner they are placed into the rooting media the better.</p>

<p>Cuttings taken with leaves usually root best, however hardwood cuttings of deciduous plants are usually taken with no leaves in winter and planted.</p>

<p>Before planting cuttings of species that are difficult to root they are treated with growth regulators or fungicides, or usually both. Growth regulators can be purchased as a 'rooting powder' which is a commercial preparation of IBA (Indole  Butyric Acid). The most commonly used fungicide is 'Captan' powder.</p>

<p>Immediately after treatment insert the cuttings into the rooting media. Difficult and slow-to-root species should have a media that is disease free. Coarse sand and peat moss is the usual media used.</p>

<p>Conditions for rooting leafy cuttings are temperature between 18&deg;C - 27&deg;C, an atmosphere conducive to low water loss from the leaves, ample light and a clean, moist, well-aerated and well-drained rooting media.</p>

<p>Simple devices can be used such as a glass jar or a polythene cover placed over a few cuttings in sand, or a box half-filled with the rooting media with a piece of glass or plastic film over the top, placed next to a window or in the shade outdoors.</p>

<p>The cuttings are ready for potting when the roots are 1-2" long. A good disease-free potting mix should be used. It is important that the potted cuttings be moved gradually from the protected conditions under which they were rooted.</p>

<p>Conditions stated are guidelines only, and experimentation to suit your climate and plant species should be carried out to ensure best results.
