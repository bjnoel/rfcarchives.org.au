					STICKY END FOR INSECTS

Fruit flies are coming to a sticky end in Barry Mohr's Brookfield orchard. This season, Barry is using a combination of a bright yellow colour and glue-type product to reduce fruit fly number to what he says is the lowest level ever on his mixed fruit property.</p>

<p>The technique is to nail a carnival-yellow lure - he uses bright yellow plastic - to the tree, then liberally coat the lure and the area immediately around it with temobi, a glue marketed specifically for trapping insects.</p>

<p>The insects are attracted by the colour, which they interpret as a ripe fruit, and are trapped in the adhesive.</p>

<p>"This is the first season ever I have not had to spray for fruit fly, and my fruit is the cleanest ever," he said.</p>

<p>Why not give it a try here in the North!
