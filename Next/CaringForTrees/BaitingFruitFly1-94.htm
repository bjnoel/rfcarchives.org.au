					BAITING FRUIT FLY?
			</h3></div>
			
		
			
		<div id="storycontainer">
<p>		
A bait spray for control of fruit fly is an alternative to chemical spraying of the entire tree. Protein hydrolysate/Maldison bait spray is registered for use in custard apples, citrus, avocados, persimmons and guava. Trials are in progress on passionfruit and kiwifruit.</p>
<p><b>Preparation</b><br>
The bait spray is prepared by mixing:<br>
10 mls Maldison 50% emulsifiable concentrate<br>
or<br>
20 g Maldison 25% wettable powder + 20 ml protein hydrolysate + 1 L water</p>

<p>50 to 100 ml of bait is applied to the foliage of each tree. The area covered should be about one square metre. The bait is freshly made for each application.</p>

<p><b>How the Bait Works</b><br>
The protein hydrolysate deposited on the plant foliage stimulates growth of bacteria. Fruit fly feed on these bacteria and while they're feeding, the Maldison insecticide kills them.</p>

<p>Spray at 7-10 day intervals and reapply the bait after heavy rain irrespective of when the last bait spray was applied.</p>

<p><b>Suppliers</b><br>
To date, there have been problems with obtaining a low-salt formulation of protein hydrolysate bait that does not burn foliage. Amalgamated Chemicals and Lanes have marketed a protein bait that is not suitable. Their bait formulation contains 20% salt as a preservative and is phytotoxic on foliage.</p>

<p><b>Why use Bait Spray instead of Chemical Sprays?</b><br>
* specific to fruit fly so it doesn't affect parasites and predators of fruit fly and other pests <br>
* quick and easy to use<br>
* less chemical costs<br>
* fewer residues in the orchard</p>
<p>Why not try it?
