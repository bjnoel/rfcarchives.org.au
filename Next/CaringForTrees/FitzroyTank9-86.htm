<p>
1.Base Fibreglass, galv. iron etc. Preferably circular, approximately 500-800 mm high and open-bottomed.</p>

<p>2. <b>Fill</b> - Half soil - half sawdust (or bagasse) or all sawdust to about 400 mm.<br>
<b>Place</b> - Preferably on concrete floor, ensure sawdust is thoroughly wet.</p>

<p>Tank should have a collar to enable a rope to be fastened to hold the plastic sheet to the tank. Galvanized iron tanks have this anyway.</p>

<p>The top of the tank should have a frame made of either light-gauge wire, or lawyer cane is ideal, preferably bee hive shape, preferably 1.5 m high or more.</p>

<p>3. Cover with heavy polythene (clear). Prefer one-piece or joined well.</p>

<p>4. Long enough to lap over the tank itself then tie to tank with rope.</p>

<p>5. Shade should be at least 100% - be careful of west wall.</p>

<p>6. Stocks - young, vigorous, preferably 400 to 600 mm high but can be attempted at younger or older stages.</p>

<p>7. Preferably terminal scions as dormant as possible, and buds ready to go - plump if possible.
May through to August is best time to graft for many species including <i>Artocarpus</i> spp.</p>

<p>8. Graft - Use wedge but cut stock high in young, soft, growth area and cut just above a leaf.<br>
Cut scion also at a node and reduce leaf area by half.</p>

<p>9. Tie with either tape or clothes pegs.</p>

<p>10. Cover grafted material straight away in tank. Make sure pots are wetted up.</p>

<p>11. Keep polythene cover closed over the tank at all times, pull down plastic and tie securely. Any air movement will give poor results.</p>

<p>12. Essential to have polythene cover virtually airtight so that there is no air flow through it.</p>

<p>13. A good seal is indicated by heavy moisture condensation on the inside.</p>
<p>Leave plants alone for at least 3 weeks, then inspect and re-water the sawdust and pots if necessary.</p>

<p>14. Do not attempt weaning until scions start to grow, in 3 to 5 weeks. Then only remove tie rope and leave another week.</p>

<p>Over next 4 weeks gradually raise a section of the sheet or give more air exposure.</p>

<p>Weaning too quickly can result in heavy losses. Watch pots after weaning commences - ensure they do not become too dry.</p>

<p>15. Fungal problems have been found to be an occasional problem in the high humidity.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on tender species in particular. Prophylactic benonyl (Benlate) sprays may be a good precaution.
