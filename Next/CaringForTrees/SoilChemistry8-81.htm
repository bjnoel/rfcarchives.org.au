<b>What is Soil? </b><br>

Soils are composed of five main components: </p>
 <div class=in>*    mineral particles - the inorganic fraction, derived mainly from rocks by weathering but including animal skeletons and opal phytoliths from plants;</div>
<div class=in>*    organic materials - dead and decaying plants, animals and animal products;</div>
<div class=in>*    water - the 'soil solution' in which nutrient elements are dissolved;</div>
<div class=in>*    air - which fills the voids between soil particles not filled by soil solution;</div>
<div class=in>*    living organisms - ranging in size from small animals to viruses. <br>
(From: CSIRO, Soils, 1977)</div>


<p>The ratio of water, air and soil is important to plant growth. Water-logging or dry soil are detrimental and stressful to plants. In soils other than coarse sand, the volume of the soil itself changes with water content.</p>

<p>Particle size is important to drainage and water holding capacity of a soil. Generally, smaller particle size increases water holding and impairs drainage. Coarser soils absorb water more rapidly. Of course, most soils are mixtures; however soil characteristic are most easily explained on 'pure' types.</p>

<p>Gravel, coarse sand, fine sand, silt and clay have a descending order of particle size. Clay particles are less than 1/2000th of a millimetre in diameter. One gram of clay can have a surface area of over one hectare!</p>

<p>As sand has no organized structure, no texture or cracks are seen in a soil cutting. A cutting also shows the various soil horizons. The quality of the top metre or two is important to the orchardist.
</p>

<p>A sponge saturated in water is a useful model to demonstrate water-holding capacity. Water-holding capacity varies, not only with particle size but is also changed by other factors, notably organic content. An organic content of at least 2% - in fact a huge quantity - can be most useful in improving a soil's water-holding capacity and availability of water to plants. This means that although a soil may not be quite dry, a plant can extract only down to a certain percentage of water from a soil. Clays hold more water than sands; however clays will retain a greater amount of water before causing plant stress.</p>

<p>Organic matter and clays have the ability to hold nutrient minerals. At a certain pH, some nutrients will be available and others are locked up. The correct pH (acidity/alkalinity) range is therefore important.</p>
<p>Organic content is improved through the addition of manure and mulching. Mulching has two further benefits:</p>
		<p class=in>1.  Soil temperature above 28&deg;C tends to be harmful to surface rootlets. Mulching keeps soil temperature down.</p>
		<p class=in>2.  Mulch will retain soil moisture.</p>
<p>Increasing organic content through mulching is a most important method available for maintaining and improving a soil, whether the fruit tree grower holds a patch of sand, clay or loam.</p>
