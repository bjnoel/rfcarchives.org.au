					ANT BARRIER

The use of an ant barrier on the trunk of custard apple trees as a means of reducing the need for insecticidal sprays for scale control is being demonstrated in a number of orchards this winter.</p>

<p>Ants tender and protect scale insects on trees, making control more difficult. However, once the ants are excluded from the tree, parasitic and predacious insects can attack the scale.</p>

<p>The material being used is a sticky polybutene (Tac Gel R) which has been dissolved by a solvent, making it easy to apply with a small paint brush onto a plastic film collar placed around the tree. The sticky polybutene is painted onto the collar and the solvent evaporates leaving an impenetrable layer over which the ants cannot travel.</p>

<p>The material works for as long as there are no branches in contact with the ground and no bridge is constructed over the sticky barrier.</p>

<p>The ideal time to apply the sticky barrier is at the start of the season in November/December when the tree is coming into leaf.</p>

<p>The research was done at the Tropical Fruit Research Station, Alstonville.
