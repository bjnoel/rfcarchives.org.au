<i>Information flowed in both directions at the R.N.A. show in Brisbane.  The RFCA put on a terrific display to educate the public about rare fruits, and in return, gleaned information about how they are eaten from visitors passing by.</i></p>

<p><b>Jakfruit:</b> Seed boiled and mashed. Add palm sugar or brown sugar to taste and make into round balls. Eat.</p>

<p><b>Jakfruit Salad:</b> Boil green jakfruit until soft. Separate rags. Add spring onions, garlic and ginger, onions, vinegar or lemon or salt and pepper. Add coconut cream. Eat.</p>
<p>Jakfruit in Sri Lanka is eaten ripe with salt and pepper.</p>

<p><b>Bunya Nuts:</b> Split raw nut and cook one minute in microwave on high. Tastes good.</p>

<p><b>Wood Apples:</b> Are cracked, sieve out seeds. Add milk and honey to taste.</p>

<p><b>Horseradish pods (Moringa):</b> These can be eaten by peeling strings of tender pods and boil in water until tender. When cooked, open and eat seeds.</p>

<p><b>Mango:</b> South American people like green mango with lemon juice.</p>

<p><b>Mamee Apple:</b> Peel and dice flesh into small pieces. Pour in water, sugar to taste, pinch of salt, ice. Use as drink. Also make into marmalade.</p>

<p><b>Dillenia (Elephant Apple):</b> Cut fruit into quarters. Drop a wedge into a glass of milk and leave overnight. It turns into a custard yoghurt. Reportedly delicious.</p>


<p><b>Durian:</b> When eating fresh durian out of shell, cut along divider on skin and allowing flesh to be removed easily and leaving a hollow. Fill with water and swirl around. Drink this water, removes odour from mouth. Wash hands in same water and removes smell.</p>

<p><b>Pomelo:</b> Pith can be put in a meat stew. Tastes lovely.</p>

<p><b>Star Gooseberry:</b> Salt and vinegar (red or white). Put in bottle and leave for seven days. Open and eat. Gets stronger if left longer.</p>

<p><b>Bilimbi:</b> Eaten fresh with salt and vinegar or just salt. Can also be chopped up with soy sauce with just a dash of tabasco sauce.</p>

<p><b>Santol skins:</b> Can be used in place of tamarind or bilimbi.
