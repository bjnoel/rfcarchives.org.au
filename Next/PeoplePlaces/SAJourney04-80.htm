Garry Thompson of Rosebud Farm gave a most interesting and informative slide display and talk on his recent visit to South America on a seed collection expedition.</p>

<p>David Chandlee has kindly provided a pr&eacute;cis of the talk:
Garry said he enjoyed Guatemala the best of all the countries he visited in Central and South America - friendly people, good fruit.</p>

<p>Northern Guatemala: the Alto Verapaz. Savannah with palms - looked like an orchard but wasn't.</p>
<p>Costa Rica - Research station at Luvialba.</p>
 <p>Amazon - Manaus (900 miles upstream from mouth)<br>
Leticia (2000 miles upstream from mouth)</p>

<p>Peach palm, red and yellow - 15' apart; edible seeds, the taste is a cross between cheese and a peach; staple in South and parts of Central America. </p>

<p><i>Spondias tuberosa</i>,  Imbu<br>
<i>S. purpurea</i>, Red Mombin - better flavour</p>

<p>Mombin, Yellow Mombin.</p>

<p>Palms - all palms - like growing together, sheltering each other. Garry recommends very close planting, 1-4 m. apart each way.</p>

<p>Tikal swamp palm - beautiful.</p>
<p>Malay apple - a beautifully symmetrical tree and  nice, crunchy fruit.</p>
<p>Paradise nut - a huge tree, to 150', good nut.</p>
<p>Brazil nut.</p>

<p>Inga - 215 species.<br>
<i>Inga siambillo</i> (pronounced shimbeyah) is a good flavoured one.<br> 
<i>I. fagifolia</i> is a good one and has beautiful twisted pods.<br>
<i>I. edulis</i> )<br>
<i>I. paterno</i>	) good, all in N. Queensland<br>
<i>I. spectabilis</i> )<br>
 'Ecuador' (botanical name unknown) beautiful young leaves.</p>

<p>Rollinia - rarely taller than 15'. Can take shade as well as sun; an all-year-round fruit although it has a chief bearing season.<br>
<i>R. deliciosa</i> - fantastic flavour.<br>
<i>R. mucosa</i> - occurs in different area; slightly inferior flavour.</p>

<p>Star apple - doesn't vary much in flavour; little difference between the green and purple varieties (apart from the colour) except that one can eat closer to the skin of the green star apple. A large tree which tolerates cutting back. (Bill Whitman's tree was shown.) Six years to fruit.</p>

<p>Sachamango - not bad, but stringy.</p>

<p>Guyana Chestnut - has a nice flower, small tree (good nut according to Meninger.) </p>

<p>Genipa - large tree to 50'; worst fruit in world?</p>

<p>Abiu - <i>Pouteria caimito</i> - a good fruit, Amazon.</p>

<p>Amazon tree grape - in clusters, dark blue/black; an excellent grape-like fruit; you can eat hundreds.</p>

<p>Mamey Sapote - large tree, fruit and seed; not much variation in flavour between seedlings and each a named variety.</p>

<p>Green Sapote (<i>Calocarpum viride</i>) - close relative of Mamey but from highlands to
8,000 feet; not noticeably different in flavour from Mamey Sapote. Both large trees.</p>

<p>Black Sapote - Garry saw few large trees, but Popenoe says it is a large tree on deep, rich, moist soil but smaller away from these conditions and at lower temperatures. Planted 15' x 15' at Luvialba (experiment). Must be fully ripe before eating.</p>

<p>Yellow Sapote - <i>Pouteria salicifolia</i> , <i>P. campechiana.</i></p>

<p>South American Sapote - large tree with delicate foliage liable to wind damage and insect attack; likes swampy clay jungle conditions, protected. Garry's favourite fruit.</p>

<p>Camu camu - <i>Myrciaria jaboticaba</i> - a shrub which makes a good drink. <br>
Jaboticaba - <i>Myrciaria cauliflora</i> - a shrub with good small fruit; crops often and heavily.</p>

<p><i>Passiflora ligularis</i> - good sweet passionfruit. "Sweet grenadilla" in RFCI list.
