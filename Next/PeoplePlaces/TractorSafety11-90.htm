					TRACTOR SAFETY IS DEADLY SERIOUS
			</h3></div>
			
		
			
		<div id="storycontainer">
		
		<p>
Tractors are one of the most used pieces of machinery on fruit and vegetable farms and are usually quite safe when handled properly.</p>

<p>However, they become lethal when operated incorrectly, and because of their size and power, any mistake can lead to serious injury or death.</p>

<p>Historically, tractor accidents have killed more people than any other rural machinery. More than 80 per cent of farm deaths involve tractors.</p>

<p>Between June 1984 and June 1990, 58 people were killed in tractor-related accidents in Queensland alone. Three out of four of these deaths result from the tractor rolling sideways or flipping backwards, trapping the operator under the machine.</p>

<p>More than half of these accidents occur on flat or slightly sloping land.</p>

<p>These accidents are preventable.</p>

<p>There have been no fatalities recorded in Australia on tractors fitted with Australian Standard roll-over protection structures (ROPS) . ROPS are a proven means of reducing deaths in rural accidents.</p>

<p><b>BEFORE YOU START WORK</b><br>
Wise growers will always use caution when handling machinery.</p>
<p>Before you start to use the tractor, be sure that you or your employees are familiar with the controls.</p>
<p>Always ride on the seat, and don't allow anyone else to ride on the tractor unless there is a proper seat, because constant loud noise is damaging to your hearing.</p>
<p>Ensure that your tractor is well-maintained.</p>

<p><b>HITCH LOW</b><br>
Estimates by the Victorian Department of Labour show that a tractor will back flip in approximately 0.5 second in fourth gear and approximately 1.33 seconds in first gear.</p>

<p>Human reaction time is 0.75 second, so it is unlikely that the operator would have time to jump clear from a back flipping tractor!</p>

<p>Remember to always hitch low, because this keeps the front wheels on the ground.</p>
<p>Hitching the load above the centre line of the rear axle greatly increases the tendency to flip backwards.</p>
<p>Use the draw bar or the manufacturer's mounting points rather than dangerous make-shift methods. (It's not a good idea to alter or modify the height of the drawbar!)</p>

<p>Never hitch around the axle-housing or to the top link pin. And be careful to engage the clutch gently when going up hill or towing.</p>

<p><b>AVOID FOLLOWERS</b><br>
Steep slopes are a special hazard for tractors and should only be worked by skilled and experienced operators.</p>
<p>Four wheel drive or front wheel assist tractors are generally safer on slopes because they provide more traction.</p>
<p>Set the tractor wheels to the widest possible setting for maximum stability.</p>
<p>Speed may cause the tractor to roll, so be careful before turning or applying the brakes.</p>
<p>Descend slopes cautiously, and lock together the turning brakes before working on hills or travelling on roads.</p>

<p>Be very careful in wet conditions because the hazard is greatly increased.</p>

<p><b>PREVENT DEATHS</b><br>
Each year tractor deaths bring heartbreak and hardship to families in Queensland. Don't think it can't happen to you.</p>

<p>Rollover protection frames or cabs are a proven means of reducing fatalities, and not one death has been reported involving a tractor fitted with roll over protection.</p>

<p>A hobby farmer invited some friends and relations to his property for lunch. He later decided to pull some rocks away from his stock yards. His guests helped him hitch a chain to the seat bracket of the tractor - about 0.3 metres above the axle centre line.</p>

<p>He was killed instantly when the high hitching caused the tractor to back flip, narrowly missing several people who were standing near the back of the machine.
