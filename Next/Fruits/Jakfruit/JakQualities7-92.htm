In response to many requests I have compiled a list of jakfruit varieties in an endeavour to compare taste etc.</p>

<p>Jakfruit varieties can be divided into two basic types according to texture.</p>

<p>Soft types which are generally used for processing such as puree and mixed in ice -creams, milk shakes, custards and various desserts. This type generally does not have a lot of latex and therefore is quite easy to open.</p>

<p>Crisp flesh types are best consumed as a fresh fruit within a relatively short time of being opened. Crisp types generally have a lot of latex (solution - vegetable oil generously spread over the knife and the operator's hands) and it can take a considerable longer time to open and process it for eating. It should be noted that most of the latex is found in the core and if, after dissecting the crisp flesh fruits lengthwise, the core is removed, most of the latex problem is solved.</p>

<h4>SOFT FLESH TYPES</h4>
<p><b>CHEENA - Champadek x Jakfruit</b><br>
This has a rich strong flavour. The arils are large, soft and yellow in colour. The fruit is cylindrical in shape and small - up to 5 kg. This fruit is particularly easy to open. Grafted plants are readily available. Recommended variety.</p>

<p><b>RELIANCE - (Seedling selection from Col and Dawn Gray, Cape Tribulation)</b><br>
Medium size fruit, prolific bearer. The flavour is mid-jakfruit range and acceptable. The texture though, is on the chewy side, arils are large. This fruit cannot be recommended at this time.</p>

<p><b>TREE FARM	- (Seedling selection from David Chandlee and Lauren Gartrell, El Arish)</b><br>
The flavour is mid to strong and acceptable. The texture is soft, fruit size is small, even roundish shape. The smallish arils are yellow in colour. This fruit is considered to be an above-average soft type.</p>

<p><b>LEMON FRESH - (Seedling selection from Joe and Ivy Zappala, Bellenden Ker)</b><br>
Medium size fruit, prolific bearer. The arils are quite soft, yellow and have a distinct lemon flavour.</p>

<p><b>BLACK GOLD - (Seedling selection by Arne Sorensen, North Qld.)</b><br>
Large fruit 10 to 15 kg. Aril texture is softish and the fruit is very easy to open. The flavour is mid-jakfruit range.</p>

<p><b>ALBA - (Seedling selection by Alba family, Atherton Tablelands)</b><br>
Soft type - reputed to be of good quality however it has not been tasted by the author.</p>

<h4>CRISP FLESH TYPES</h4>
<p><b>HEW	- Importation by Kamerunga Research Station, Cairns</b><br>
Known also as NA/HEW. Medium to large size fruit. The arils are many and medium in size with a slight orange colour. Aril texture is crisp and of excellent flavour. This is one of the easiest crisp types to open. Grafted plants are not readily available as yet. This variety has been recommended by Kamerunga Research Station.</p>

<p><b>N.A.N.S.I. - Importation by Kamerunga Research Station, Cairns</b><br>
N. A. N. S.I. is medium to large in size but more cylindrical in shape than Hew. The arils are yellow in colour and crisp in texture, flavour is very good. This variety has been recommended by Kamerunga Research Station but is not readily available.</p>

<p><b>HONEY GOLD - (Seedling selection by Arne Sorensen)</b><br>
Honey Gold is a medium size fruit that would appear to have a pollination problem. That is, not all of the arils are present, which leaves the fruit with a lumpy appearance. From a limited amount of trials in this area, it is possible that the application of Borax might solve most of this problem. Regular application of a complete fertilizer, e.g. dynamic lifter, also appears to be of assistance.</p>

<p>The arils are very large, fine and crisp in texture and excellent flavour. This is a difficult jakfruit to open and has a lot of latex. Grafted trees of this variety are readily available and is recommended by the Kamerunga Research Station.</p>

<p><b>GALAXY - (Seedling selection by Fitzroy Nursery)</b><br>
Galaxy is medium in size and even in shape. The arils are smallish, large in number and yellow in colour. Aril texture is crisp and the flavour excellent. This is a variety which is recommended by Kamerunga Research Station. This variety was used for tasting in the recent Horticultural Display in Rockhampton - 99% of those people who tasted it rated it as excellent.</p>

<p><b>ZIEMAN - (Seedling selection by Zieman family from Darwin)</b><br>
Zieman is a medium size fruit. The arils are orange-pink in colour and very crisp in texture. The flavour, though good is not considered by the Author to rate as highly as either Honey Gold and Hew. Grafted plants are available but at this time not in large numbers.
