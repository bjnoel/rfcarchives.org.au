Jakfruit is a native of mountainous districts of India.</p>

<p>The jakfruit tree is something marvelous to see as its fruit are produced on the trunk and on the stronger and bigger branches. The fruit are very large and barrel shaped. Some fruits are reputed to weigh up to 50 lbs. The skin is brown-yellow in colour, rough with hard pointed studs allover the surface, the colour turning more brownish as the fruit ripens. The fruit are mostly oblong to oval and average around 45cm or 18" in length, but the fruit vary in shape from tree to tree.</p>

<p>Most people do not know how to eat a jakfruit and are often put off as they have attempted to eat the unpalatable part of the fruit. The correct part to eat is the fleshy section around the seeds. The best time to split a jakfruit is when you can press the fruit in slightly.</p>

<p>The flesh has a nutty, creamy fruity flavour and the ripe fruit has a strong smell somewhat similar to a ripening banana.</p>

<p>I have been told the jak fruit may be eaten green by first greasing the fingers to stop the sap sticking to hands and then removing the flesh around the seeds; then cook by steaming with butter or oil, and it is supposed to taste like the best asparagus.  I have yet to try out this method.</p>

<p>The jak fruit tree is a hardy, striking tree to grow, with its deep green leathery glossy leaves. It is easily propagated by seed and the tree grows very rapidly. Depending on the area and conditions, it can reach a height of a fairly large tree. Some trees I have seen are spreading in habit while others are tall and slender.</p>

<p>The jakfruit will grow in most soil types but does best where the soil is deep and well drained. It must have hot and humid conditions but can stand some cold of around 3&deg;C.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to be said about the jakfruit. It is definitely a must in one's garden.</p>
