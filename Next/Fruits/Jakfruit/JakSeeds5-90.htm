Although jakfruit seeds do not generally come true to type, the most common method of raising jakfruit trees is still by seed. In tropical areas, seedling trees usually come into bearing within 4 to 8 years but in cooler areas they have been known to take up to 14 years to bear fruit. Seedlings in the Yeppoon area have been known to fruit at 4 to 5 years.</p>

<p>As jakfruit seeds lose their viability very quickly, it is recommended that the seeds be soaked in water.  Large, heavy seeds need about 24 hours, while small, light seeds up to 96 hours. This will not only improve germination up to 100% but also increase the speed of germination.</p>

<p>You should also be sure to remove the 'skin' from the seed, as failure to do this will result in extremely poor germination.</p>

<p>When transplanting or planting out jakfruit seedlings, one must be very careful in order not to damage the long, slender tap root.</p>

<p>Jakfruit trees should be only planted in well-drained areas, as they will quickly die if they become waterlogged. Care should therefore be taken to ensure that the media used when propagating the seeds is well-drained and that it is constantly kept moist.
