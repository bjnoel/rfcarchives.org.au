The Rosella is native to Southern Europe and is now grown in most subtropical areas, mainly for the fleshy parts of the fruit which are used in the preparation of teas, jams, and other preserves. The plant is perennial, but is grown as an annual herbaceous shrub, some four-feet-high with large-lobed leaves and yellow, hibiscus-like flowers. The fruit are harvested before they are fully mature while the tissues are still tender with little fibre.</p>

<p>The crop is grown from seed on moderately fertile soils which are well-drained. A basal dressing of 5-13-5 complete mixture at the rate of 4 cwt. per acre is desirable on all but the more fertile soils. Planting takes place in the spring, the seed being sown in seedbeds in drills spaced approximately 4 inches apart. The seedlings are transplanted when they are about 6 inches tall, into rows about 3 feet apart, with a plant spacing in the row of 2-2&#189; feet apart.</p>

<p>Little hand-chipping is required in the rows if the land has been well-prepared for the crop, but inter-row cultivation will be needed to suppress weeds. Irrigation ensures a long cropping period and should be practised wherever possible; inter-row cultivation can then be carried out after each watering.</p>

<p>Growth is rapid, and flowers appear some six weeks after the plants are set out in the field. The first fruits are mature and ready for picking three weeks later. Harvesting takes place before the fruits become woody, and regular picking at weekly intervals is essential for a good quality product.</p>

<p>The edible part is not actually a fruit, but part of the calyx and bract which surround the petals of the flower. The calyx is fleshy and with an acid taste.</p>

<p>Rosellas are usually graded for the size and colour, and marketed in sugar bags or trays.</p>

<p>The calyxes (or husks as some books refer to them) can be used for many culinary purposes. As well as making jam, jelly, chutney, sauces, drinks, they can be added to stir fries, salads, curries and muffins.</p>

<p>The seed pods are quite hairy and prickly and it is advisable to wear gloves when separating them. A piece of half-inch piping which is sharpened at one end can be used to cut the end out of the bract and peel it off. An apple corer might achieve the same effect.</p>

<p>There are a lot of recipes for Rosella Jam, some using just the calyxes or husks, while others use the seed pods as well. Rosella calyxes may also be dried - remove the seed first.</p>
