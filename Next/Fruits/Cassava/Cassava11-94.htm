The cassava plant is a shrub growing to 2-3 metres that produces an edible tuber that can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes. The plant has very attractive foliage and is sometimes grown solely for its ornamental value. Tubers can be harvested from 6 to 8 months. I have found they are nicest when young as they tend to become very fibrous as they get older. The tubers should be crisp and break easily, discard any with blue-grey streaks.</p>

<p>Cassava tuber has more carbohydrate and less protein than other root vegetables but does contain some vitamin C. The leaves are also edible and contain some protein, minerals and vitamins. Choose young leaves, wash, place in saucepan and cover with water. Boil for 5-10 minutes with lid off. Drain water and discard, cover with fresh water and steam until tender with the lid on. (15-20 minutes). Cassava tubers and leaves must not be eaten raw.
