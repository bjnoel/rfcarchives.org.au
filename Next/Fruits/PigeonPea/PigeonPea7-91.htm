The pigeon pea is a short-lived tree (five or six years in frost-free areas) reaching a height of ten feet. The peas are produced in pods, three to eight peas to the pod, and are about one-quarter-inch in diameter. The pods are easily opened when they are dry. If left on the tree, they will open spontaneously at the proper time and plant themselves. The tree may be damaged by frost and may be killed at 26&deg;F.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, the tree will bear the year it is planted and all summer through subsequent years. The dried peas may be kept through the winter and planted in seed beds in February, then planted outside in mid-March or later.</p>

<p>The tree will grow rapidly in good soil, likes water, but will stand drought. The limbs are long and slender, becoming pendulous under good conditions.</p>

<p>There are two varieties of pigeon pea. The most common is from Central America and is brown when dry. A larger variety from Kenya is a marbled rust color. The flavor is different, more like peanuts or soy beans than English peas. They may be boiled like other dried beans, with ham, or used in soups.</p>

<p>The young green seeds are used as a vegetable in many countries and have been canned in Puerto Rico and Trinidad. The green pods are sometimes used as a vegetable, also. The plants are used as excellent cattle fodder and also can be made into hay and silage. Pigeon peas are planted as green manures and cover crops, used as temporary shade, windbreaks and for erosion control. The dried stalks are used for firewood, thatching and basket making in India.
