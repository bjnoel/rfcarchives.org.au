For some time I have heard of a Breadfruit tree at Shute Harbour near Proserpine.</p>

<p>As this plant requires a very tropical climate, possibly the most difficult plant to grow away from the wet tropics, I have been keen to see it.</p>

<p>On a recent trip up the coast, the group (Rob Weston, Merv Kruske, Dr. Coronel and myself) decided to chase up this tree. After a drive up and down and around Shute Harbour, we spotted "it" hidden behind an avocado tree. It was tall and slender with a good leaf coverage (mid-winter) and with a number of male flowers.</p>

<p>Mr. Peter O'Dowd, the owner, said it was a Breadnut approximately 11 years old and purchased from Limberlost Nurseries. The next-door neighbour had a very large Breadnut tree that was over 3 years old before he had to chop it down. Its roots were blocking up the septic system. As conversation continued, it seems that it was the deceased tree that we were originally looking for and while doing so we met two friendly fruit enthusiasts and heard of another tree in the Strathdicki area.
