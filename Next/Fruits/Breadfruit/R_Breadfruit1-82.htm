					BOILED BREADFRUIT
			</h3></div>
			
			<div id="storycontainer">	


<p>This is a round starchy fruit about the size of a football. It has a tough green skin and a corky centre. It is chiefly used when fully grown but green. However, ripe fruits can be made into puddings and cookies. It may be used in any dish to replace English potatoes.</p>

<p><b>Boiled Breadfruit</b><br>
1 green but mature fruit (about 1 Kg)<br> 
1 tsp. salt<br>
1&#189; cups water or coconut milk</p>

<ol><li>	Boil water in a large saucepan, stir in the salt.</li>
<li>	Remove stem, wash fruit and cut in half from top to bottom, then cut the halves into quarters and eighths. Cut out the centre core if desired.</li>
<li>	Place the pieces, skin downward into the saucepan.  Cover closely.</li>
<li>	When it begins to boil, lower the heat and cook slowly till all water is absorbed. Turn the pieces after the first 15 minutes. They should be cooked in 25 minutes. Check by using a skewer.</li>
<li>	Cool slightly, peel thinly, cut into pieces. Serve warm as the starchy dish of a meal.</li></ol>

<p>Breadfruit also makes delicious hot chips, when prepared as for English potato chips.</p>

<p><b>Food Value</b><br>
About 3&#189; oz. of the edible portion will produce somewhat over 103 calories. It has also been found to contain about 70.8% water, 1.7% protein, and about 26% carbohydrate, with traces of various minerals and vitamins. (C.F.N.I. Tables)
