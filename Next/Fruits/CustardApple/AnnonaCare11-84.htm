In September, 1981, the atemoyas (<i>Annona cherimola</i> x <i>A. squamosa</i> Hybrids) African Pride and Pink's Mammoth were pruned and defoliated to observe effects. The plants flowered immediately on bud burst and this was all that was noted.</p>

<p>In April 1984, the above was carried out again in a range of <i>Annona</i> sp. (<i>A. atemoya, A. reticulata, A. cherimola, A. muricata, Rollinia deliciosa, R. mucosa</i>) and the growth hormone Gibberellic Acid (G.A.3) was applied to the flowers to observe the effect on fruit set.</p>

<p>A moderate to heavy pruning was carried out followed by an Ethrel&#174; spray at 50 P.P.M. on half the pruned trees of each species. There was little difference between the Ethrel-treated and untreated trees, especially the <i>A. cherimola</i> and <i>A. atemoya</i> where the pruning removed virtually all leaves.
Bud burst and flowering occurred immediately on the <i>A. atemoya</i> and <i>A. cherimola</i>; the <i>Rollinia</i> species followed with <i>A. muricata</i> being vegetative and <i>A. reticulata</i> last but with flowers.</p>

<p>G.A.3 sprays commenced weekly at 50 P.P.M. African Pride was the only tree to respond to this concentration for the first 3 weeks, so the rate was increased to 100 P.P.M. The Pink's Mammoth and Cherimola set at this rate under adverse weather conditions. None of the other species responded.</p>

<p>It was concluded that pruning and G.A.3 sprays at 100 P.P.M. weekly can be used to produce fruit out of season in <i>A. atemoya</i> and <i>A. cherimola</i> on varieties African Pride, Pink's Mammoth and Mossman respectively.
