<p><b>What are they? </b>They are a type of Banana used extensively in the West Indies as a vegetable.</p> 
<p><b>How to prepare them</b> - I have found them a most versatile fruit or vegetable depending on how they are served.</p>
<p><b>Some suggestions:</b><br>
With salads - serve 3 or 4 thin slices with meat and or vegetable salads. (Fruit must be fully mature, that is, about equivalent to an overripe ordinary banana);<br>
Fruit Salad - use in the normal way (Fruit must be fully mature);<br>
Grilled or Barbecued - Cook slices 1 inch thick until tender and serve as a substitute for eggs.<br>
Equally as tasty with fish, chicken, steak or pork. Fruit can be used at any stage of ripening;<br>
Boiled or Baked - Cook in a similar manner to potatoes. Fruit should be green but fully developed;<br>
As a Dessert- Fry lightly in superfry and serve with cream or ice cream. PlantaIns make excellent fritters.</p> 

<p>To peel a green banana or plantain remove ends, cut skin lengthwise on each corner and peel each section.</p>

<p>These are normal uses of the plantain. Exotic recipe books offer many variations of uses. Plantains are available only in Douglas Shire.</p>
<p>Plantains keep much better than ordinary bananas and can be kept under normal household refrigeration. The skins may go black but the fruit retains its quality.</p>
<p>HAPPY PLANTAINING!</p>
