<p>
The genus <i>Spondias</i> belongs to the Anacardiacae or Cashew family, which also includes the mango.</p>

<p>It has about 8 to 10 species in the genus found in the tropics of Asia and America. The fruits of some of these species constitute an important source of food in their native areas.</p>

<p><i>Spondias cytherea</i> (syn. <i>S. dulcis</i>) is commonly called the Ambarella or Otheite Apple. The species forms a medium-sized tree 12-15 metres tall, with a smooth bark and large pinnate leaves to 40cm long. The flowers are borne terminally in spring and fruits ripen in the autumn and early winter.</p>

 <p>The fruit is 6-8cm long and 5-6cm in diameter. The skin is yellow when ripe and somewhat leathery. The edible flesh is yellow in colour and about 1 cm thick. The stone, or seed casing, has spines that stick out into the flesh and complicates the use of the fruit. Seeds are produced in 5 small cavities in the stone. Only 1 or 2 of the seeds will be developed. There is some variation among seedlings, some being sweeter and with a thicker flesh than others.</p>

<p><i>S. cytherea</i> can be grown from a seed or from cuttings. The Ambarella is the hardiest of the spondias, taking a little bit more cold than the others.</p>

<p>They require good drainage, but will grow in rich or poor soils. They have to grow in full sunlight to produce fruit. A shaded tree will produce little or no fruit. The trees are also drought tolerant. They will go dormant in late winter.</p>

<p>The fruits usually drop off when they turn yellow. I have found that they can be picked green and they will turn yellow in about 5 days at room temperature. The taste is reminiscent of pineapples. The fruit can be used in jams, jellies and sauces when ripe, and when unripe, in pickles or relishes. A very tasty jam can be made.</p>
