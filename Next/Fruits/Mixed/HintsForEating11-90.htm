<b>BLACK SAPOTE</b><br>
<img src="../../FruitImages/BSCalyx11-90.png" align="left" alt="Sketch of Black Sapote">
The fruit of the Black Sapote is round or tomato-shaped. It changes green very slightly The best way to tell when it is ripe is to watch the calyx. When the fruit is developing, the calyx sticks to the skin. When there is a noticeable gap between the calyx and the fruit, it can be picked and it will ripen in a few days at room temperature. The skin will change colour to browny green and will be soft to touch. If it ripens on the tree, it usually falls off - splatters on the ground and can't be used.</p> 

<p>The fruit can be frozen whole with the skin on. Before it is totally defrosted, peel the skin off. It is easy and not too messy to use.</p>

<p>Fresh fruit can be cut into two and the flesh scooped out, or it can be pushed through a sieve to catch the skin and seeds. The pulp can be frozen for up to one year. It is a useful additive in breads, cakes, pikelets, desserts and drinks.</p>

<p><b>JAKFRUIT</b><br>
Fruits can be long, round or barrel-shaped. Some turn from green to yellow or yellowy-brown when ripe.
Usually at the junction of the fruit and tree branch there is a single leaf. It turns from green to yellow when the fruit is turning ripe.  Pick the fruit and it will soften at room temperature. Generally ripe fruit has an odor and it is soft to touch.</p>

<p>Before opening the fruit, coat hands and utensils in cooking oil to prevent the latex sticking to everything.</p>
<p>For a crisp-fleshed jakfruit, the best method is to cut the jakfruit into quarters. Remove the centre from the quarter. Run the knife along the skin and the arils.</p>
<img src="../../FruitImages/JakProfile11-90.png" align="right" alt="Sketch of Jakfruit slice">

<p>The arils will lift and separate from the 'rags', or stringy bits. Cut out the seeds from the aril. The flesh can be put in plastic bags or containers and frozen for up to one year.</p>

<p>The flesh can also be dehydrated. Soak overnight in honey that has been drizzled over the top. Split and flatten the arils and put on dehydrator trays. Dry for 12-15 hours or until dry to touch. Store in airtight jars.</p>

<p>The arils can be left whole or stuffed with cream cheese. Top with a pecan nut.</p>

<p>The soft-fleshed jakfruit is easier to 'clean'. Cut the fruit longitudinally. Usually the arils adhere to the centre stalk when the stalk is tugged out. The pulp can be frozen as well. These arils can be blended for use in ice-cream and drinks.</p>

<p>The arils of the jakfruit can be covered with milk and boiled. The milk when drained off and cooled, will congeal and form a pleasant orange-coloured custard.</p>

<p>The seeds can be collected and frozen for up to a year. The seeds can be boiled in salty water until soft. They taste similar to cooked potatoes or chestnuts. The seeds can also be roasted.</p>

<p>An unripe jakfruit can also be used as a vegetable by cooking it. Split a small, green, unripe jakfruit open with a sharp knife into four lengthwise pieces. The core in the centre can be discarded. The skin can also be removed, leaving a fibrous flesh. Slice this flesh into medium-thin slices and soak these pieces in plenty of cold water. Boil the slices in slightly salted water for 15 minutes or until tender. The latex left in the saucepan can be removed by rubbing with oil.</p>

<p>I have read, but not tried, that young tender leaves and young male flower clusters may be cooked and served as a vegetable. Surplus jakfruit can be fed to cattle, as it is considered to be a good stock food. Young leaves are also eaten by cattle and other livestock, as is said to be fattening.</p>

<p><b>STAR APPLE</b><br>
The fruit comes in two colour forms. The purple star apple turns from green through purple to dark purple. Pick when it is a dark purple and slightly soft to touch. Chill, cut in half and spoon out seeds and eat.</p>

<p>The green star apple is green-skinned and the colour will lighten when ripe. The best method is still to feel the fruit, and when slightly soft to touch, it is ready.</p>

<p>Ripe fruit will not fall, they must be picked off the tree. Scoop out the pulp and store in containers. It freezes well for use in ice cream, desserts and drinks.</p>

<p><b>GRUMICHAMA</b><br>
The round berry fruit turns from green to bright red to dark purple to black-purple. Best picked and eaten when the darkest purple. Easy to eat, just spit out the seeds. It can be made into jams and jellies. The juice can also be extracted and frozen for later use. Just mash the fruit, cover with water and cook for about 10 minutes. Drain through a jelly bag. Use in ice cream or sweeten to taste and use as a drink.
