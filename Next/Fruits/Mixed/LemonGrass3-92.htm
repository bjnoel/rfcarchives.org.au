LEMONGRASS, the sweet rush, is an unusual herb which resembles the flax plant family in its appearance and habit of growth. The leaves are long straps of fresh bright green. They sheath the stems which grow from a fleshy base.</p>

<p>The plant is quite decorative, and in one growing season should make a clump approximately 15cm (six
inches) across at the base and 60 cm (two feet) high. Lemongrass is fast-growing, and will fit happily into a courtyard planting, where it will thrive in the hottest position if given plenty of water.</p>

<p>Lemongrass is propagated by lifting the clump and pulling away rooted pieces from its outside edges, or a sharp spade can be used to break the offsets away from the main clump. Simply plant the rooted pieces into their permanent position. A little compost and well-rotted chicken manure in the soil will ensure quick healthy growth of the new plant.</p>

<p><b>CULlNARY USES</b><br>
Lemongrass leaves can be used to make a delicious lemon-flavoured tea. Simply chop two or three fresh leaves very finely, place them in a teapot and pour on boiling water. Let it stand for several minutes before serving. Add a little honey if required. </p>

<p>The roots of the plant can be used fresh to give a subtle lemon flavour to many oriental dishes. Simply dig them from the soil, wash, and grate or chop finely.</p>

<p><b>MEDICINAL</b><br>
Lemongrass tea with honey added can be used to help soothe winter coughs and colds. It contains quite large amounts of vitamin A.</p>

<p><b>COSMETIC</b><br>
Lemongrass, used regularly, will help give a clear skin and bright eyes. Its aromatic oil is used in many skin-care preparations.</p>

<p><b>IN THE GARDEN</b><br>
Lemongrass planted closely in clumps will provide an excellent poultry-proof hedge around the vegetable patch. It can also be used to keep couch grass and other creeping grasses out of the garden.
