Okra, also known as Gumbo, is a member of the hibiscus family. It is cultivated for the pods, which are harvested in the immature stage and used in salads and soups.</p>

<p>The plant is widely cultivated throughout the tropics and can be grown during the summer in south-east Queensland. It cannot tolerate frost.</p>

<p>Commercial production in the State is small, because of the limited market demand, and any marked or rapid increase in production would destroy the market.</p>

<p><b>SOILS AND PREPARATION</b><br>
Okra can be grown on a wide range of soils, provided the internal soil drainage is good. Thorough soil preparation commencing two to three months prior to planting is recommended to allow organic matter in the soil to break down. A ripping, followed by a deep-ploughing and several cultivations should bring the soil to a good planting condition. The addition of lime or dolomite may be necessary during soil preparation to bring the pH to about 6.0 to 6.5.</p>

<p><b>CULTURE</b><br>
Seed may be sown direct in the field in rows 1 to 1.5 metres apart. The plants are later thinned to a spacing of 30 to 45 cm when they are 10 to 15 cm high. Alternatively, seedlings may be grown in seedbeds or seedling growing trays and later transplanted into the field. Planting is best done on slightly raised beds.</p>

<p>The variety most commonly grown in Queensland is Clemson's Spineless. Fertiliser may be applied at sowing and should be banded below and to the side of the seed. A 5:6:5 NPK mixture is quite suitable at about 1.3 kg per 20 metres of row. A side-dressing of Nitram at 225 g per 20 metres of row can be applied, if necessary, when the first pods have been picked. The nitrogen fertiliser should be used sparingly, as pod-setting and maturity may be delayed if excessive amounts are applied.</p>

<p><b>HARVESTING</b><br>
The market demand is for young tender pods about 7 to 10 cm long. Older, tough, and stringy pods are unsaleable. The pods should be ready for harvesting within 10 weeks of planting, and regular pickings every 2 to 3 days are essential for maximum yields. The tender pods are broken from the stalks and must be handled carefully, otherwise they may bruise and discolor. It is advisable to wear rubber gloves when harvesting and handling okra pods, as the sap of the plant will irritate most skins.</p>

<p>The pods are best graded into various sizes and then packaged in a 9-litre fibreboard container. Okra should be stored at a temperature between 7 to 10 degrees C, with atmospheric humidity of 90 to 95 per cent to prevent wilting. The container should be labelled 'okra' and also show the name and address of the grower.</p>

<p><b>PESTS</b><br>
There are many pests which may attack okra, but among those most likely to be troublesome are the Heliothis, rough bollworm and looper caterpillars, and the green vegetable bug. These four pests may be controlled by spraying with endosulfan (ENDOSULFAN). The insecticide should be applied according to the manufacturer's directions.</p>

<p><b>DISEASES</b><br>
Verticillium wilt is probably the most common disease affecting okra. The conspicuous symptom is a typical wilting of the plant. The only control measures that are recommended for dealing with this disease are crop rotation and the destruction of diseased plants.</p>

<p>Ascochyta leaf spot and Cercospora leaf spot have been recorded on okra. No definite control measures have been suggested but spraying with a dithiocarbamate fungicide may be helpful if either of the leaf spots prove destructive.</p>

<p>Root-knot nematodes (<i>Meloidogyne</i> species) cause severe galling on okra roots. Infested soil should be treated with EDB (ethylene dibromide), 7 to 10 days before planting.</p>

<p><b>USES</b><br>
The main use of okra is for cooking with meats as a flavoring and because of the high mucilaginous content, the pods are ideal for both thickening and flavoring of stews and soups. The pods can also be boiled or fried and eaten as a vegetable.</p>

<p>The small okra market demands young, tender pods about 7-10 cm long. Older pods are unsaleable.
