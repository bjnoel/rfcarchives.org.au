<b>Origin:</b> Tropical America and West Indies</p>

<p>The name arrowroot is curious and there are several explanations for it. Some say it was named by Central American Indians who used the root as a cure to absorb poison arrow wounds. Another explanation is the use of the root as the actual poison! A third and more likely explanation is that it is an approximation of its American Indian name 'araruta', meaning 'flour root'.</p>

<p>The best arrowroot comes from Bermuda but is scarce and expensive. Most of the arrowroot we see today comes from the West Indian island of St Vincent where there is thriving arrowroot industry.</p>

<p><b>Description:</b><br>
Arrowroot is a perennial plant which grows 60- 180cm high. The leaves are large, fleshy and bright green. The white flowers are produced in twin clusters. Arrowroot rarely produces seeds; when it does the seeds are red. The rhizomes (tubers) are the part of the plant used. These fleshy, cylindrical shaped rhizomes can grow 2.5cm thick and up to 45cm long. They are usually covered in scales. There are many varieties of arrowroot, but the two main cultivars are 'Banana' and
'Creole'.</p>

<p><b>Growing Arrowroot:</b><br>
Arrowroot grows best in tropical - sub-tropical climates, but will adapt to warm temperate areas. The minimum annual rainfall required to grow arrowroot without irrigation is 98-150cm, which should be well-distributed throughout the year. A short dry season in winter will not affect plant growth. Arrowroot grows best in temperatures between 20&deg; - 30&deg;C.</p>

<p>Low temperatures in winter will slow plant growth; often the leaves will brown and die. Mild frost will kill the leaves, but not the tubers. To rejuvenate the plant, cut the leaves at ground level. The rhizomes will shoot new leaves in spring. Arrowroot will benefit from heavy mulch.</p>

<p><b>Soil:</b><br>
To grow good-sized rhizomes, a deep, well-drained, slightly acid loam is best. The plant will not tolerate poor drainage. Light shade is beneficial, especially if the soil is light and sandy.</p>

<p><b>Fertilizing:</b><br>
Commercial crops of arrowroot in St. Vincent, in the West Indies, receive an 8:5:14 NPK mix at 900kg/ha 14 weeks after planting.</p>

<p><b>Watering:</b><br>
Plants should have moisture available to them throughout the warmer months.</p>

<p><b>Propagation:</b><br>
'Bits' are used for propagating arrowroot. These are pieces of rhizome 4-7cm long, with buds on them.</p>

<p>Bits can be planted from spring onwards, but the beginning of the rainy season is best in drier areas. Dig holes about 8-15cm deep, drop the bits in and cover with soil.
Keep the area around the young plants well-weeded, or use mulch, The bits are usually planted 30-40cm apart in rows 75cm apart.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting:</b><br>
The rhizomes should be ready to harvest in 10-11 months from planting. Dig up rhizomes when the leaves begin to die down. Once harvested, the rhizomes should be processed within two days ('Banana' cultivar) and seven days ('Creole' cultivar).</p>

<p><b>Pests and Diseases:</b><br>
Arrowroot is usually problem-free. In commercial plantations, leaf roller is the only important pest. Root rot can be a problem in badly-drained soil.</p>

<p><b>Uses:</b><br>
<b>In the kitchen:</b><br>
The rhizomes of arrowroot are processed to produce arrowroot flour, a common ingredient in cakes, biscuits, custards and as a thickener in gravies and sauces. Arrowroot flour is clear when cooked, unlike wheat or corn flour which 'cloud' a sauce.</p>

<p>The rhizome of this versatile plant can also be used as a vegetable like a potato - baked, boiled or fried.</p>

<p>When cooking arrowroot as a vegetable, use young rhizomes 2-10 months old.</p>

<p>Arrowroot is an especially valuable food for infants and invalids as it is very easy to digest.</p>

<p><b>In the garden:</b><br>
Arrowroot makes an excellent fast-growing windbreak - much used in Permaculture gardens. When planted with a row of lemongrass and comfrey, it forms an almost impenetrable barrier to invasive grasses. Arrowroot closely-planted around a vegetable patch or chook run creates a warm, wind-free microclimate.</p>

<p><b>On the farm:</b><br>
Cows, goats and donkeys will eat the leaves as well as the rhizomes of arrowroot. Geese are fond of the rhizomes too. Arrowroot is a good standby fodder for dry times. Not long ago, in Queensland, arrowroot was widely grown for feeding dairy cows, as well as for human consumption.</p>

<p><b>How to make Arrowroot flour:</b></p>
<p>1. Wash rhizomes, peel skin carefully. The skin will give a bitter taste to the flour if it is left on. The inside of the rhizome should be white and fleshy.</p>

<p>2. Wash the peeled rhizomes and grate into a coarse pulp.</p>

<p>3. Put pulp into a large bowl and pour cold water to cover well.</p>

<p>4. Let the pulp settle, the flour will sink to the bottom of the bowl.</p>

<p>5. Pour off the water and fill the bowl again with clean water.</p>

<p>6. Repeat step five until the water remains clear.</p>

<p>7. Strain, pour pulp onto a tray in a layer 1-2cm thick.</p>

<p>8. Dry in the sun, until you have a dry flour.</p>

<p>9. Store in an airtight container.
