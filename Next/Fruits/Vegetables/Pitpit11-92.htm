Pitpit belongs to the same family as sugarcane - the grass family. It is widely distributed in the Malaysian tropics; Malaysians call it 'Tebu bertelur' and in Java it is 'Teboo endog'.</p>

<p>In the growing season, it shoots up very quickly and is usually higher than a man. In Morobe it grows more or less all the year round but in Port Moresby it has a distinct season, usually appearing in the markets about the middle of the dry season.</p>

<p>In town gardens, Pitpit should be planted on your back boundary and used as a hedge. It takes up a lot of room, and is usually tied to a stake when it gets to three feet or so.</p>

<p>After the flowers have been harvested, you should cut the old stems down and chop them into small pieces for mulch. Propagation is by division of the old clump. In South East Asia, the clump is carefully dug around, old or broken canes cut down, and then it is covered with pig manure and straw until it is time for new shoots again.</p>

<p>The part of the plant which is eaten are the flowers: as the buds swell, the plant looks as if it had a lot of long thin, sweet corn on it. The flowers do not open, and at the right time are cut off and sold in the markets in bundles of from two to ten.</p>

<p>Pitpit can be baked in the oven as it is and when cooked, the sheaths are peeled off and the succulent creamy shoot is then ready to eat - you can add butter and pepper and salt and it is delicious. It can also be baked in the ashes or on hot coals.</p>

<p>Various other recipes have developed over the years.</p>
<p>Boil the pitpit until tender, cover with a white sauce with grated cheese and chopped onions on top and bake until brown.</p>

<p>Better still, cover the pitpit with coconut cream and cook it in the oven in a covered dish.</p>

<p>Boil until tender, drain and put in the refrigerator: cover with a thick salad dressing and chopped onions: it makes a delightful meal with cold, sliced, tinned bully beef, or even ham.</p>

<p>Add pitpit to all stews and soups. It has a protein value.
