I have established an orchard of pomegranate with encouragement from David Noel, President of our Association (WANATCA). During the last four years, over 200 trees were planted on my property in Yarloop, 120km south of Perth on the slopes of the Darling Range.</p>

<p>Last year I had the first small crop of pomegranate fruit and the quality of the fruit was excellent. The quality was much superior if we waited long enough, to the stage when the shell of the fruit split by itself. The seeds inside were darker than from the specimen I bought in the shop (imported from California) and they were close to a burgundy colour. A drawback was that once the fruit opened, attacks by birds were much more frequent.</p>

<p>My general impression was that they are fairly bird-resistant and it was possible to have a crop without any special precautionary measures. It is possible that the birds are simply unfamiliar with this particular crop. It worries me that they may acquire a taste for them in the future. Parrots learn very quickly and I found they have an excellent memory, especially what concerns quality. A high degree of natural protection is derived from the bitterness of the shell and the dividing membranes in which clusters of the pomegranate seeds are lodged.</p>

<p>Pomegranate is a very hardy tree, growing in different positions on my farm. Being of Mediterranean and Middle East origin, it is very drought-resistant but grows much better with good supplies of water. I was surprised to find out that they do not mind "wet feet".</p> 

<p>Completely forgotten in some places, without any supply of water in summer and eaten many times over by the sheep, they survived and regenerated with multiple small branches. Because of these properties they are excellent for dense impenetrable hedges.</p>

<p>Flowering starts in late spring and continues into summer; at the beginning of February I still have new flowers coming on, and therefore on the same bush we can see well-developed fruit together with new flowers. Only heavily pruned trees bear fruit. In North Africa I had a large pomegranate hedge which was never pruned, and I never had one single fruit from it.</p>

<p><b>CULINARY USES</b><br>
I was first introduced to pomegranate when it was offered to me sprinkled with red wine. The seeds can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes; they make a most attractive garnish and look highly appetizing when sprinkled on any meat dish. An attractive-looking salad dish can be made by mixing chopped walnuts, a little finely-chopped shallot and cream cheese together, moulding them into balls or rolls which are then pressed into the red seeds so that they are pleasantly coated.</p>

<p>Juice from pomegranate is very tasty and refreshing. One can add seeds to fruit salad to give a colourful appearance.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Pomegranates propagate very easily from cuttings whether they are big or small, thin or thick, short or long. Sufficient supply of water at a critical time secures success. Cuttings can be transplanted to bigger pots in the middle of the summer or planted directly into the ground in winter. That makes them very inexpensive to start with.</p>

<p><b>MEDICINAL PROPERTIES</b><br>
Pomegranate is used by herbalists for many disorders. Pomegranate seeds have been used as a remedy for tapeworm since the time of the ancient Greeks. Its high tannin content makes the rind of fruit an excellent astringent for internal and external use.</p>

<p>Pomegranate seeds eaten in moderation will help digestion, increase peristalsis and prevent constipation. Eaten in large quantities, similarly to prickly pear, they could cause severe blockage requiring medical intervention.</p>

<p>Pomegranate is very much worth growing, not only for its taste and nutritional value but also for its exceptional beauty. By the end of the season, being a deciduous tree, it will display European-type autumn colours sprinkled with golden-red, very attractive fruits which, stored in a cool place, will give you enjoyment for many months.
