<p>
The first major fruiting of Star Apple (<i>Chrysophyllum cainito</i>) has occurred with some people's trees having up to 100 fruit in different stages of maturity and flowers still being set.</p>

<p>Most of the trees I've seen that have fruit are seedlings about 3 to 4 years old, with a few 'Haitian' and 'Grimal' cultivars, and a few seedling 'Green' Star Apples also cropping heavily.</p>

<p>The shiny purple-skinned, round fruit about 8cm in diameter, is easily cut around its circumference and parted to reveal a star-shaped centre of translucent pulp. The remainder of the fruit, though more fibrous, was edible to within &#189;cm of the skin.</p>

<p>The delicious sweet fruit has flavours reminiscent of grape and melon, however, fruit should be well-coloured and mature, as immature fruit have an objectionable sticky latex, especially near the skin.</p>

<p>The Star Apple tree is very attractive as an ornamental alone. A medium to large evergreen tree, its weeping form and glossy, velvet, green leaves, with a gold underside, gives the tree its ability to change from green to gold with a small wind. Unfortunately, seedling trees can have flower pollination problems, which leads to shy and even non-bearing trees, an aspect of sapotaceous fruits.</p>

<p>Either as a commercial or back yard tree, the Star Apple shows plenty of merit, and will easily gain acceptance in the market place.
