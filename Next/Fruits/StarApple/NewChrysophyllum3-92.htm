<p>
A new species of <i>Chrysophyllum</i> has recently been called to the attention of the Editors by Robert Pulvirenti of Southport in South Queensland. Most growers know well the Caimito or Star Apple (<i>Chrysophyllum cainito</i>), which is a Winter and Spring fruit. There are also many "Greenleaf" Star apples planted around the North Coast area; this is a related species which has leaves light green below, and the fruit of which is similar, but perhaps a little superior, to the caimito.</p>

<p>The newly revealed fruit is <i>Chrysophyllum imperialis</i> (synonym <i>Martiusella imperialis</i>). The parent Australian tree is growing in the Sydney Botanic Gardens. The seed of this tree was sent from Rio de Janeiro state in southeastern Brazil.</p>

<p>The round, brown-skinned fruit is softly pubescent or downy to the touch, and about 7.5 cm in length, including a small point at the base. The flesh inside is custardy, has a sticky texture, and is good to eat. The seeds are much like those of the Australian native <i>Planchonella</i>, a sapotaceous "cherry" common to Queensland rainforests. They have only a short viability.</p>

<p>The tree is of slow growth, at least in South Queensland. The leaves are large and thick, oval to elliptic in shape, with a serrated edge. The new leaf flush is pubescent.
