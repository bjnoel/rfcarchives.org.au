<p>The Grumichama, <i>Eugenia brasiliensis</i>, makes a fine home garden specimen.</p>

<p>A fine handsome tree with glossy, deep green leaves, small white flowers, and reddish young growth. Only four or five weeks after flowering the round, purple-black fruits are ready to harvest. The flesh is soft, melting and sweet like a cherry The thin, delicate skin is also edible. Also known as the Brazil Cherry, and belongs to the same family as the pitomba, and the pitanga.</p>

<p>Trees perform satisfactorily in a tropical or subtropical climate. Soils should be slightly acidic, moist, and contain plenty of organic matter. Drought tolerance is low. Shelter from strong winds is advisable. A sunny to semi-shaded position is preferred. Young plants benefit from shade until established.</p>

<p>Seedling trees should only take three to five years, or less, to bear fruit. There are no named varieties that can be recommended at this stage. Variation includes pink or white flowering types.</p>

<p>Plant in warmer months at least 2 metres from existing trees or buildings. Water in well to settle the soil around the roots, and mulch. Apply frequent dressings of poultry manure as fertiliser. Keep the soil moist but don't overwater as plants may drown. Little or no pruning is necessary as trees grow compactly and maintain an attractive shape.</p>

<p>Flowering occurs in winter and spring months and the fruit is ready to harvest some four to five weeks later. Small clusters of fruit hang down in long stems. They colour from green to red to purplish black when mature.</p>

<p>No serious pests or diseases affect production.
