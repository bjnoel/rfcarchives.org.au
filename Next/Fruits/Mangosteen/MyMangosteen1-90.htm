This purple mangosteen was grafted 3&#189; years ago. When the photo was taken on 16.11.89, the tree had 68 flowers or young fruit on it. Some branch tips had clusters of 4 fruit. No doubt some will fall off, but each year we manage to retain a higher percentage as we learn more about its cultural needs.</p>

<p>There are two other grafted mangosteens growing close to this tree and they currently have 48 and 17 flowers respectively.</p>

<p>The first mangosteens were grafted about 8 years ago. We made a lot of mistakes in those early days, through a lack of understanding of their requirements of water, fertilizer and light.</p>

<p>As well, we were grafting them too high and getting a lot of suckering below the graft union. If the sucker was allowed to grow it would dominate the growth at the expense of the graft.</p>

<p>Grafted mangosteens can be coaxed into fruiting each and every year after grafting, if treated correctly in regard to fertilizer and water timing.</p>

<p>Occasionally we still hear of some of the early grafted trees producing a crop but I think a lot of them were allowed to sucker below the graft and eventually reverted to seedlings status.</p>

<p>I have always been very enthusiastic about grafted mangosteens, especially as seedlings take 8 to 10 years to fruit, and one day when all my other projects are under control, I shall set out to prove the economics of them in an orchard situation.
