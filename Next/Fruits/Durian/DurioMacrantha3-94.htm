<b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
<i>An interesting species of Durio from North Sumatra is described and illustrated from a living specimen growing in Bogor.</i></p>

<p>In 1981 I received from Mr. H. Rijksen a young durian plant, which he had collected in the Mt. Leuser National Park in North Sumatra. Now 10 years later the plant has grown to a tree of 10 m high in my private garden in Gadok near Bogor, and in July 1991 it started to come in bloom. The flower bunches appeared on the bare branches; it took 4-6 weeks from the initial bud to the mature flower. The tree flowered profusely and within three months new buds appeared continuously. It proved to be an undescribed species of durian.</p>

<p><b>DURIO MACRANTHA Kosterm., species nova</b><br>
Tree 10 m tall, dbh. 20 cm. Bark smooth, grey. Crown pyramidal, lowest branch 1m above the forest floor, somewhat drooping. Leaves alternate in one plane, chartaceous, lower side concave, oblong, 5-7.5 x 16-22 cm, gradually acuminate or sub-acuminate, base rounded, above very dark glossy green with minute reticulation, midrib slender, impressed, ribs filiform, prominulous in a groove; below very densely light golden brown lepidote, scales minute, flat with rather irregular margin. Petiole 10-15 mm slender. Flowers on the bare branches, consisting of a short thick main peduncle with few, 2-3 cm long, thick branches, each bearing 2-4 flowers. Pedicels stout, 4-5 cm long, gradually thickened apically. Flower buds initially depressed globose and ultimately subovoid-globose. Calyx urn-shaped, the 5 sepals connate, apically with 5 triangular, acute, 5-7 mm long broad lobes, lepidote outside. Petals free, white, glabrous, large, consisting of a thick, flat, stiff, wide, clawlike part, gradually widened apically and ending in a strongly reflexed much thinner spathulate-orbicular apical part. Stamens in 5 phalanges of 5-7 stamens each, the filaments fused in their basal half, the free parts 2-3 cm long, bearing clumps of one-celled anthers. Ovary oblong, densely minutely lepidote, showing a slight longitudinal furrow. Style reddish, glabrous, rather fleshy, up to 5 cm long, surpassing the stamens, cylindrical with conspicuous capitellate stigma. Fruit immature with numerous very hard and sharp, sub pyramidal thorns, the latter covered by numerous very tiny fimbriate scales.</p>

<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
Mt. Leuser National Park, North Sumatra, described after a cultivated specimen in the private garden of D. Kostermans in Gadok near Bogor, Java.</p>

<p><b>PHENOLOGY</b><br>
Flowers open in the afternoon and drop in pieces during the night. They have no smell and no nectar. Pollinators are perhaps bats and night moths. The flowers had always a few black ants.</p>

<p>The branch basis are surrounded by a high annulus of tissue, free from the branch, as if they had to push the bark aside when developing.</p>

<p>The species is outstanding among the 3 other species so far known by the large flowers.
