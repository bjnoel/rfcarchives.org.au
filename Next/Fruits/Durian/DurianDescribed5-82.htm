This noble fruit is held in such high esteem in S.E. Asia that it surely deserves a better description than "something that fell off the back of a garbage truck".</p>

<p>A fully ripe, undamaged Durian smells strongly fruity and sweet. In fact, it smells delicious. The unique odour comes from thioether and ester compounds in the aril, but as yet these compounds are not well defined. The Durian taste could also be described as strongly fruity and sweet with a heavy carbohydrate character to it. The flesh contains only 2.5% protein but is very rich in carbohydrates: about 150 calories per 100 grams.</p>

<p>The problem of smell only arises when the fruit splits on the lower end, the flesh oxidises and ferments, and it then becomes smelly like any other rotten fruit. Most fruit stalls in S.E. Asia have a nearby garbage bin full of rotting Durian skins and this pollutes the whole area and leads to those unsavoury descriptions.</p>

<p>The beginner should follow a few rules. Firstly sniff the fruit for a few days, to build up a desire for it. Then eat only 1 or 2 spoonfuls on the first attempt, and soon you will be an ardent Durian lover.</p>

<p>The hot flushes one may experience soon after eating a Durian are simply a part of the aphrodisiac effect.</p>
<p>Best of luck with your first Durian!
