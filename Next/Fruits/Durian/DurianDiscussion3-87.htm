The following topics were discussed at the session:</p>
<p>1.Marketing situation</p>
<p>2. Quality control</p>
<p>3.  Insect and disease pests</p>
<p>4.  Varieties</p>
<p>5. Quality of chemicals and agricultural
materials</p>
<p>6. Irrigation and water crisis</p>
<p>7. Basic knowledge for growers, and</p>
<p>8. Cost of labour and qualification.</p>

<p><b>1. Marketing Situation</b><br>
Growers have not been able to obtain good prices from the produce as they should. Supply tends to be over the demand due to the outcome of the produce at peak yield period. New varieties are needed to even out distribution of the produce throughout the season. The lack of appropriate farmer organizations makes growers helpless in controlling marketing system.</p>

<p><b>2. Quality Control</b><br>
The lack of quality control measures permits under-standard and low quality produce to get into the markets. Growers try to get evade the low price crisis at the peak yield period and under-mature durians are harvested.</p>

<p><b>3. Insect and Disease Pests</b><br>
Stem rot, leaf burn and wood-eating insects were discussed. Certain chemicals  have been found to be effective in controlling stem rot, but most growers cannot afford the price.</p>

<p><b>4. Varieties</b><br>
The existing commercial varieties are acceptable. However, new varieties are also in demand by growers and certain criteria as being odorless or having less spines, small or undeveloped seeds and good for processing, and a few other purposes for industry were speculated.</p>

<p><b>5. Quality of Chemicals and Agricultural Materials</b><br>
The use of pesticides, fertilizers as well as some other chemicals in durian cultivation is high. However, growers lack basic knowledge of how to cope with the propaganda put up by the chemical dealers, and have always been victimized.</p>

<p><b>6. Irrigation and Water Crisis</b><br>
Water supply, especially during the dry months, is very critical for durian cultivation. Water stress will cause premature fruit drop, low quality fruit and in severe cases, the trees die. Shortage of water due to depleted water supply has been an ever-increasing problem and needs technical resolution urgently.</p>

<p><b>7. Basic Knowledge For Growers</b><br>
Growers requested basic training in orchard cultivation and management.</p>

<p><b>8. Cost of Labour and Qualification</b><br>
The present cost of labour is acceptable to growers but the qualifications of labourers need to be upgraded. Qualification is defined as skill and past experience as well as appropriate basic training before undertaking the job.</p>

<p>Management and administration of the fruit industry are small-holder type. Plantation system should be incorporated.</p>

<p>NOTE: The above article on Durian was obtained by John Marshall during the 1985 S.E. Asia Fruit Tour to Bangkok.
