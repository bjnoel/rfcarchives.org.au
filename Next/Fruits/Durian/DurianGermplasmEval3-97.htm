RIRDC Program 1.1 New Plant Products - Tropical Fruit</b></p>
<p>Joe and Alan Zappala of Bellenden Ker in North Queensland will be involved in the above project title. They started 1 July 1996 and will finish 30 June 2001.</p>

<p><b>Objectives</b></p>
<p>1. The introduction of the best durian clones of Asia from guaranteed budwood sources.</p>
<p>2. Propagation of these clones (single and multi­root-stocked) with the best nursery practices.</p>
<p>3. Development of an Industry Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>4. To compare growth rates and performances under different soil types and climatic regimes.</p>
<p>5. To evaluate and monitor nutrition requirements and in particular clonal tolerances to pests, diseases and strong winds.</p>
<p>6. To identify clones best suited for Phase 2 (Yield and Fruit Quality Assessment) for future Australian planting and export potential.</p>

<p><b>Outcomes</b><br>
The Development of a successful durian industry in Australia will be achieved by:</p>

<p>1. The development of an industry strategic plan, including swot analysis workshops of growers and researchers from NT and NQ, to be completed by June 1997. This will focus the efforts of growers, researchers and funding bodies to ensure positive outcomes are achieved. Concurrently NT DPI &amp; F and QDPI will facilitate the formation of grower groups, databases of plantings and industry problems, and a quarterly newsletter.</p>

<p>2. The successful importation program and nursery establishment of the 30 best clones from Asia are 80% complete.</p>

<p>3. The establishment of 2 durian trial plots, each of 150 trees (5 trees of each clone) in existing wind-protected orchards and the use of red volcanic and granite gravel soil types will provide an excellent range for growth studies.</p>

<p>4. The installation of a weather station will ensure accurate climatic data recording.</p>

<p>5. Results from regular soil and tissue sampling will monitor macro- and micro- elements, pest and disease tolerance observations and other clonal trials.</p>

<p>6. Correlating all research outcomes and merging this data together with the wealth of knowledge and experience gained by overseas visits, personal contacts, and the latest research information from MARDI and other Australian research institutes will enable the correct clonal recommendations and production practices to be completed and advanced to Phase 2.</p>

<p><b>Background, relevance and potential benefits</b><br>
Durian, an extremely nutritious fruit, is the highest priced and most loved fruit of Asia. Initial Australian Gross Returns indicate a possible income of $60 000 per hectare for 10-year-old trees. (Dr T.K. Lim Horticulture Australia 1995 page 443-446). Our Australian Industry lacks good quality productive clones and presently growers have limited management experience. Currently there are several major growers and more than a dozen miscellaneous growers in both NQ and NT.</p>

<p>Thailand already exports fresh durian to many countries including Japan, Europe, US.A., Canada and frozen fruit into Australia. Australia's present quarantine restrictions prohibit the importation of fresh durian. Thailand's production is expanding to supply the ever increasing global demand. With Australia's growing Asian population, there is a ready domestic market available for the preferred fresh, good-quality fruit. A successful Australian durian industry has the potential of exporting in Asia's off-season, and will supply our domestic demand. Additional benefits include: Potential value adding, increasing employment, greening Australia and aiding diversification for our tropical primary producers.</p>

<p><b>Research strategies and methodology</b><br>
The best clones from Asia were privately imported and are already released from Quarantine. These clones are currently being multiplied and will be established in 2 durian trial plots each of 150 trees (30 clones x 5) on two different soil types in existing wind-protected orchards. Standard cultural practices will include planting on mounded beds, shading for the initial 6 months of field establishment, common nutrition and irrigation practices and dual rootstocks for all trees will be utilised to decrease the juvenile phase, provide increase wind tolerances, improve <i>Phytophthora palmivora</i> resistance and help reduce rootstock incompatibility. Each cultivars' cold tolerance performance and tree vigour, resistance to wind damage, tolerances to pests and diseases will be recorded. Regular monitoring of soil, leaf and climate data in relation to tree phenology will establish basic patterns for clonal comparisons in North Queensland. These observations will also include the monitoring of the existing durian orchards which consists of 150 trees from ages 1 to 8 years, established with single rootstocks and the effects of ground cover crops on soil borne disease suppression and fertility enhancement. Regular visits by Dr T.K. Lim and Q.D.P.I. Research Staff will assist with the initial project setup and assess progress and performance.</p>

<p><b>Timelines</b><br>
Installation and operation of weather station to be completed by August 1996.</p>
<p>Compilation of an Australian Durian Industry Strategic Plan by June 1997.</p>
<p>Successful field planting of trial plots by completed by July 1997.</p>
<p>Major Project Review by June 1999.</p>
<p>Possible first fruiting of new clones by February 2001.</p>
<p>Complete data appraisal to identifY best commercial clones for Phase 2 completed by June 2001.
