In the Kamerunga durian collection, 3 cultivars have now fruited - Chanee, Chompoosee and Hontong. Chanee trees have borne for the past three years, but Montong and Chompoosee for the first time in the 1986/87 season.</p>

<p>A number of characteristics are now documented for the three cultivars.</p>

<p><b>FLOWERING</b><br>
Chanee normally flowers over a long period, July to November inclusive. Montong and Chompoosee flowered from July to November in 1986 also.</p>

<p><b>POLLINATION</b><br>
Nectar flow appears restricted in any flowering before August/September and some fruit may set in May/June but is often without seed and aril development.</p>

<p>In 1986 fruit set and development was obtained with and without hand pollination on all 3 cultivars. The presence of pollinating bats and insects is not yet studied.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT DEVELOPMENT</b><br>
There is a peculiar corollary in that the Thai classification of cultivars is for both age to fruiting and for period of fruit development. Cultivars which flower and fruit in the least number of years also have fruit with the shortest development period. Chompoosee appears to take 3 to 4 months from fruit set to maturity, Chanee 3&#189; to 4&#189; months and Montong 4 to 5 months.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS</b><br>
The greater the number of fruit set and held the smaller the mature fruit size. Our weight ranges have been:</p>
<div class="in">Chompoosee - 900 g to 3.4 kg</div>
<p></p>
<div class="in">Chanee	- 2.0 kg to 5.5 kg</div>
<p></p>
<div class="in">Hontong	- 2.0 Kg. to 5.7 kg</div>

<p>Chanee has previously produced fruit up to 6 kg. One seven-year-old Chompoosee had 45 fruit harvested this year and fruit size was generally smaller than another Chompoosee with 28 fruit.</p>

<p><b>MATURITY</b><br>
Maturity judgement comes with visual experience and is not easy to describe except that fruit become duller green and then may exhibit slight yellowing between the locules just prior to fruit drop.</p>

<p>Fruit drop from the grafted Thai varieties does not usually result in fractured fruit unless falling from more than 6m.</p>

<p><b>STORAGE</b><br>
Aril extracted at the correct stage (not overripe) will maintain good appearance and flavour if wrapped in 'cling wrap' (to prevent moisture loss) and stored at 3 to 5&deg;C for at least 4 weeks.</p>

<p>Storing whole fruit in refrigeration results in substantial fruit weight loss if kept for an
extended period. Whole fruit must be kept relatively dry and with humidity not exceeding 60%.</p>

<p><b>ARIL/SEED CHARACTERISTICS:</b><br>
Chompoosee has few aborted seed and generally a higher seed-to-aril ratio than the other two cultivars. Flesh (aril) is yellow only for dropped fruit or fruit picked within 4 to 5 days of natural drop. If picked not properly mature and then allowed to soften, aril will generally turn out whiter in colour. However, ethylene ripening does improve colour relative to controls and ethrel-treated.</p>

<p>Chompoosee aril is generally softer in texture (wetter) and stronger in flavour than Chanee and Montong.</p>
<p>Chanee has some aborted or flat seeds. If fruit are picked outside 7 days of natural drop then aril colour is pale. As well, some parts of the aril segments may ripen unevenly, leaving both soft and hard areas. These are characteristics of Chanee reported elsewhere.</p>

<p>Our Montong was obtained from Singapore and we have been uncertain about its true identity. However it has excellent quality in the current harvest and if it is not Montong then certainly it has equivalent quality. Aril is golden yellow irrespective of maturity, the flesh very firm, seeds all small, (flattened or aborted) and aril recovery is excellent.</p>

<p><b>PESTS</b><br>
Fruit spotting bug is a major pest and if uncontrolled, stings on green fruit develop into rots. Mealy bugs with attendant ants are becoming more noticeable and exudates grow sooty mould which is also objectionable in appearance.</p>

<p><b>COLD TOLERANCE</b><br>
Chanee and Montong perform better than Chompoosee at Kamerunga. Cool winters tend to cause some defoliation and interfere with flowering on Chompoosee. It would suit a warmer climate.</p>

<p>However, yields of up to 82 kg this year (45 fruit) off a 7-year-old tree is very interesting. The warmer winter has favoured cropping.</p>

<p><b>CLONE IDENTIFICATION</b><br>
We have had reservations about the authenticity of the Chanee and Montong clones we hold. However from characteristics of the fruit sampled so far, they appear to be true to name.</p>

<p>In Thailand a number of sub cultivars are often called by the same name; for example there are several types of Chanee and thus identification can be confusing.</p>

<p><b>PRECOCITY</b><br>
If you are concerned by the fact that your durian tree does not set fruit from its first year of flowering, then don't be alarmed. It is common experience in all countries for poor fruit set in the first year.
