Considerable interest is currently being shown in the durian in Far North Queensland and stock is becoming fairly readily available.</p>

<p>A native of the Malaysian peninsular, probably originating in Borneo, it is popular throughout South East Asia and many named varieties are now established. Cultivars originating in Thailand are considered to be the best and also to be well-suited to Australia.</p>

<p>The tree can grow up to 40 metres in the rain forest, but grafted trees are around 8 to 10 metres. Leaves are simple, alternate, slightly elliptic; 10 to 20 cm long with light green, smooth upper surface, bronze underside, slightly rough.</p>

<p>Trees flower in three to four years in the case of grafts, while seedlings take at least seven years. Flowers grow in clusters along the almost horizontal branches. Fruit take about three months to develop and ripen.</p>

<p>The fruit varies in shape from round to ovoid and in size from 10 cm to 35 cm long, whilst the average is about 20 cm long and 17.5 cm wide. Generally olive green in colour, the exterior of the fruit is in four or five segments of thick, hard skin covered in hard spines 1 to 2 cm long, making it difficult to handle with bare hands. When ripe, the fruit falls from the tree and has a very short life of two to five days before spoiling. The shell is opened into the four or five segments to reveal the seeds (up to seven per section) embedded in an aril of custard-like consistency. Colour is usually cream, but some orange varieties exist. It is this very rich pulp which is eaten.</p>

<p>Probably the most controversial fruit in the world, it is very highly prized (and priced) by its devotees. On the other hand, the very strong, offensive and sickly odour of the fruit is too much for others. As a fruit, it is either loved or hated. I have known the durian for some 35 years and have yet to meet anyone who had a "take it or leave it" attitude towards it.</p>

<p>As is always the case with such exotic foods, their glamour is supported and surrounded by much folklore and local custom.</p>

<p>In Malaysia, superior trees gain a reputation and people travel many miles to obtain fruit from a specific tree, which they acclaim over all others. Some will spend a day's earnings for a single fruit.</p>

<p>Some primitive tribes bury the aril and eat it when fermented.</p>

<p>Many taboos exist concerning eating durian together with other fruit. I was warned in all seriousness never to eat durian and rambutan together. According to some other theorists, a cold shower within half an hour of eating durian could have fatal effects.</p>

<p>Chop a few leaves into your bath water, however, if you want to cure jaundice, whilst ground-up root taken on the third day of a fever will work wonders. Rub the inside of the shell on your skin to get rid of skin disease - and many more.</p>

<p>The prime claim to fame is the aphrodisiac properties of the durian, claimed to be the finest in the world.</p>

<p>So - grow it - try it.
