The pitaya cactus belongs to the Cereus, or night blooming cactus family. It is native to Mexico and Central America, where the fruit is very popular. It is a rigorous climber, the stems being three-sided, jointed and heavy. The stems are fleshy and have short spines. The fruit are usually oval in shape with small fleshy leaf-like protuberances. The purplish red-skinned fruit has the same colour inside. The soft pulp is juicy and delicious with small, black, edible seeds embedded in it. It contains a fair source of Vitamin C.</p>

<p>The yellow-skinned pitaya has more thorns on the stems and large clusters of spines on the fruit. The spines are easily rubbed off. The soft flesh is white and juice with a pleasant flavour. Small, black, edible seeds are embedded in the pulp and crackle between the teeth when eaten.</p>

<p>There may be a pollination problem if there are no insects around. Ants do pollinate the flowers, but if you have no insects, hand pollination will work.</p>

<p>The best method of eating is to serve the fruit chilled and remove flesh from the half-shell with a spoon.  The fruit keeps well frozen, either whole or pulped.
