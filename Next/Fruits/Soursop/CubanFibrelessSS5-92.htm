The 'Cuban Fiberless' soursop was introduced into Florida by the writer in 1959. This was just prior to the Castro take-over of Cuba. At that time, Ing. Filiberto Lazo, Horticulturist at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Santiago de las Vegas was concerned. It was his desire to get some of their improved tropical fruit varieties off the island before the change in government made this impossible.</p>

<p>With Lazo's cooperation, an approach grafted 'Cuban Fiberless' soursop was received and eventually planted out in my Bal Harbour, Florida grove. After 6 to 8 years and only three fruit, a seedling from one of these Annonas replaced the original nonproductive introduction. This bore no better. However, a further seedling from this second generation tree finally bore heavily and was named by Miami horticulturist Crafton Clift the 'Whitman Fiberless'. This more productive strain is being propagated in preference to the original Cuban introduction.</p>

<p>Grown from seed, the fiberless fruit usually shows a tendency to be a shy bearer. While its productivity may vary from seedling to seedling, its fiberless characteristics remain constant. Also, the dull-colored, smoky-whitish appearance on the upper leaf surfaces never change and is a sure indication the fruit will be fiberless. Other so-called fiberless soursops from Latin American sources have more recently been introduced into Florida. As far as I am aware, none of these have produced fiberless fruit as anticipated.
