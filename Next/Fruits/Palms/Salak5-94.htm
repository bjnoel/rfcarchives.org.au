In Northern Queensland, most tropical fruit growers are not aware that the so-revered Bali salak is not the only salak variety loved and consumed in Indonesia. The myth that the Bali salak is far superior than other varieties must be put straight.</p>

<p>At a salak and nangka (jakfruit) contest in 1990, which was held in Malang, East Java, the salak Suwaru was proclaimed Indonesia's best fruit, leaving the other salak varieties far behind.</p>

<p>The popular Sewaru salak has been developed from trees which were growing in the Pasar Minggu district near Jakarta. This area has grown salaks for more than a century without noticeable improvements of the fruit.</p>

<p>Seedlings from the Pasar Minggu variety were planted in the desa (small village) Bululawang in East Java. The different climate and soil probably caused the much-sought-after improvements of the fruit. Further propagation again led to even better varieties.</p>

<p>After careful selection, one of these seedlings was planted in the desa Suwaru, near Malang, East Java, which finally produced the now famous salak Sewaru.</p>

<p>The horticultural section of Primary Industries in Malang has since tried to find more new varieties of the Suwaru salak and some popular varieties are Dody, Sari and Damang.</p>

<p>The main features are:</p>
<p><b>Dody</b><br>
This variety has the biggest fruit and it weighs from 140-180 grams or 6-7 in a kilogram. Flesh thickness is 7-15 mm, gold-yellowish in colour and juicy. It consist of three parts, each with a small seed and little aroma and rather sweet tasting. Colour of the skin is light brown. Production is low, only 8-14 fruits per bunch, and not many bunches are produced per season.</p>

<p><b>Sari</b><br>
This variety is the best producer of the three. The fruit size is average and weighs 70-100 grams. The bunches, normally 3-4 per season, bear up to 35 fruits each. The flesh is 3-13 mm thick, of a white-yellowish colour and crisp, and has a strong fragrance. The seeds are very small. The skin is much darker brown than Dody.</p>

<p>Sari has been used to develop more varieties of the Suwaru strain of which SII, SIll, SIV and SX (Code names) look very promising.</p>

<p><b>Damang</b><br>
The characteristics of Damang are quite similar to Sari, though the colour of the flesh is of a very dark yellow. Between 10-16 fruits go in one kilogram. The three parts are not so regular in size, with often 2 big parts and 1 small one. The flesh is 5-12 mm thick and not so crisp as Sari.
