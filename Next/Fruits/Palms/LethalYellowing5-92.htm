The Florida Market Bulletin, February 1, 1992, has reported that a DNA-based test for lethal yellowing has been developed by University of Florida Plant Pathologist, Nigel Harrison. It is hoped that this DNA probe, the first-ever test of its kind, will enable scientists to finally control this plague.</p>

<p>Lethal yellowing has decimated not only the graceful Jamaican Tall-type of coconut palm throughout Florida and the Caribbean, but destroyed many other types of palms as well. It will kill a palm in a few months; in 1971, a rooftop view would have revealed Miami's coconut trees stretched out in all directions like a sea of emerald feathers. By 1973, every corner seemed to host a bare pole with a few brown fronds clinging to it. We tried desperately to save ours, devising a makeshift giant hypodermic to inject expensive doses of 'black market' tetracyline into it. To no avail; the heartbreak remains with us today.</p>

<p>Having learned of this exciting development just at press time, we cannot elaborate further at this moment, but plan to report upon it more fully in the very near future.
