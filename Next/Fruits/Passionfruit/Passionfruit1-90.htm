<b>Origin</b><br>
<i>Passiflora</i> is a large genus with several edible species. The best known of these are:<br>
&#149;  <i>Passiflora edulis</i> - the purple passionfruit;<br>
&#149;  <i>Passiflora quadrangularis</i> - the giant granadilla;<br>
&#149; <i>Passiflora edulis, var. flavicarpa</i> - the yellow passionfruit; and<br>
&#149; <i>Passiflora laurifolia</i> - the water lemon.</p> 

<p>Passionfruits may be grouped into two forms: the purple-fruited and the yellow-fruited forms. The purple-fruited form is a native of Brazil, while the yellow-fruited form presumably originated in Australia as a mutant from the purple passionfruit or it may have been introduced from tropical America. The purple passionfruit thrives in the subtropics and tropical highlands whereas the yellow passionfruit adapts better to the tropical lowlands.</p>

<p><b>Plant Description</b><br>
<i>Passiflora</i> is a vigorous climber. It climbs by means of tendrils which curl around supports, therefore it requires to be grown on trellises. Leaves have a net venation and are arranged alternately on the vine. They are usually shiny above and dull below. The flowers have rays of thread-like corona radiating in a circle from the centre and are rather showy. They are fragrant and hang solitarily from the vine. They open in the morning and close by late afternoon. The fruit is round or oval and are bright yellow or purple when ripe. Its shell-like rind is smooth, within which are numerous small seeds. The seeds are embedded in a yellow juicy aromatic pulp which is the edible part. It has a tart but pleasant flavour.</p>

<p><b>Harvesting</b><br>
Mature fruits of the giant passionfruit are clipped from the vine with care, as they bruise easily. Fruits of the other species should be left on the vine until they fall, for full development of flavour.</p>

<p><b>Propagation and Cultural Requirements</b><br>
It may be propagated from seeds or by stem cutting or grafting. Seeds should germinate within 2- 4 weeks. The plant will start to flower within 2- 3 years. It is difficult for a single plant to bear fruit, as pollination requires at least two plants with bees or flies as pollinating agents.</p>

<p><b>Pests and Diseases</b><br>
Viral diseases, nematodes and soil fungi are obstacles to passionfruit cultivation. In order to control fungal diseases such as Fusarium wilt and Phytophthora blight, it is advisable to plant cultivars which are grafted onto resistant rootstocks. At the same time, protective spray with ManCoZeb or Captafol during prolonged wet weather should also be carried out. Viral diseases may be minimized by making cuttings from virus-free plants and selecting virus-tolerant hybrids for planting.</p>

<p>Fruit flies, which damage young fruits, can be controlled by carrying out fortnightly spray with either Carbaryl or Trichlorfon during fruit-setting period. Hanging fruit fly traps containing a mixture of Methyl Eugenol and insecticide as a bait is another control measure.</p>

<p><b>Culinery Use</b><br>
Passionfruit is rich in vitamins. The fruit may be eaten fresh out of hand by halving the fruit and scooping out the pulp and pips with a spoon. Alternatively, the pulp extracted from the seeds can be made into juice, ice-cream, yogurt or fruit salads.
