<b>GENUS <i>PASSIFLORA</i> - PASSIONFRUIT</b><br>
The passionfruit is closely related to the pawpaw, and has been grouped in the Papayaceae which is now divided as Passifloraceae and Caricaceae (also related to the Cucurbitaceae). Some previously named Tacsonia; now a subgenus of Granadilla. A large genus (400) with many edible species (50- 60) [9]. Four native species and 7 naturalised. Most species originate in America (in tropics or subtropics). 'Passion' refers to the crucifixion (Latin pass us suffering). Missionaries who accompanied the conquistadors to South America used the passionfruit flower as an illustration of the truth of Christ	. . . 10 petals and sepals for the apostles present at the crucifixion; the halo of filaments for the Crown of Thorns; the 5 anthers for the 5 wounds; the 3 stigmas, the nails; the coiled tendrils,the whips; the ovary, the sponge soaked in vinegar.</p>

<p>Most species are vigorous, perennial, woody vines climbing by means of unbranched axillary tendrils. Other features of the genus are alternate leaves, often with glandulate petioles (stalk); bisexual flowers generally with colourful complex corona (ring of appendages inside corolla (the petals) and with a superior ovary on a gynophone (special stalk); fruit, a berry with hard, tough, leathery skin or shell - varying in size from pea to melon; numerous seeds with pitted testa (hard, protective, outer, seed coat) surrounded by a pulpy aril (fleshy appendage found on some seeds). Flowers open in the morning (night and early morning [2] and close by late afternoon (receptivity decreases to zero by noon of the following day [2]. Some species have self sterile flowers.</p>

<p>Propagate by seed, stem cutting or grafting. Many hybrids (some fertile) have been investigated. Seeds germinate 2-4 weeks. Seed can be difficult to germinate (best sown fresh, no need to remove aril, fermenting for a few days may help). Drying seed is best done in the shade [7]. Cuttings of firm wood taken over summer usually strike readily (of pencil thickness). Long tip cutting coiled extensively in pot should strike ... says a local source. Try growing on vegetable garden edges as wind break and mulch source. Can be used as a weed control ... just grow over rampant weed areas or as ground cover. Looks good in flower arrangements (may need hot water treatment before they will take water well.</p>

<p>Viral diseases, nematodes and soil fungi (Fusarium wilt, Phytophthora blight) can give problems. Can graft on to resistant rootstock. For information re disease and pest control see Library .... Disease Control, Fruit and Nut crops a disease management guide, and Insect Pests of Fruit and Vegetables .... both by DPI.</p>
<p><b><i>P. alba</i></b>	see <i><b>P. 'subpeltata</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>P. alata</i></b>	Peru; edible yellow fruit; crimson flowers with red, purple or white corona.</p>

<p><b><i>P. antioquiensis</i></b>, Karst ... BANANA PASSIONFRUIT; synonym <i>P. van-volxemii</i>; species name from area of origin in Colombia (high altitudes [9]); similar to <i>P. mollissima</i> except flower - vigorous climber with soft hairy new growth; brilliant red flowers on white stalks; narrow elliptical yellow fruit (12 cm) with orange sweet edible pulp; subtropical to warm temperate; sunny position, rich loamy soil, water in dry periods, tolerates light frost only.</p>

<p><b><i>P. aurantia</i></b> ... BLUNT-LEAVED PASSIONFRUIT; native of Australia (NE QLD to NE NSW and Pacific region); contains cyanogens but edible at least in small quantities [4]; orange-red flower (may be white or pink) to 11 cm across, clusters of pale green fruits; tropical to temperate; keep pruned to avoid becoming sparse; successful in baskets; filtered or partial sun, good drainage, plenty of water, tolerates light to moderate frosts.</p>

<p><b><i>P. cinnabarina</i></b> ... VERMILION PASSION FLOWER, RED PASSION FLOWER, CRIMSON PASSION FLOWER; native to Australia (temperate NSW, VIC, TAS); contains cyanogens (not listed as edible); popular in cultivation (including overseas) for its flowers and as a screening plant. Large succulent edible fruit [12]. Drought tender but frost resistant [12].</p>

<p><b><i>P. coccinea</i></b> ... SCARLET PASSIONFLOWER;	South America (Guiana); species name - scarlet; heart-shaped leaves with toothed margins; brilliant scarlet (with yellow reverse) flowers; ovoid, greenish, striped, hard-shelled fruit with aril edible (Sturtevant); tropical to subtropical; sunny position, rich soil and plenty of water, tolerates light frost.</p>

<p><b><i>P. edulis</i></b>, Sims ... PURPLE PASSIONFRUIT, PURPLE GRANADILLA, LILIKOI (Hawaii) Native of Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and West Indies; latitude 0-30. Naturalised in parts of NSW, QLD and VIC (favours cool moist areas, rainforest margins). Grown commercially extensively only in Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, South Africa and Hawaii. Vigorous evergreen vine with deep-green shiny, usually lobed, leaves (often undivided in young plants). Flower mauve and white with 3 large hammer-shaped stigmas. Insects required for pollination (mainly bees but also wasps [2]. Cross pollination usual but anthers mainly dehisce late in the day the flower opens and then self pollination is possible. Pollination of one lobe of the stigma is sufficient for complete fertilization, but fruit set, size and pulp yield is influenced by the amount of pollen grains. From pollination to fruit fall is 60 to 80 days. (Adverse weather - rain [2] - can interfere with pollination (stopping bees or spoiling pollen) .. esp southern Victoria). Cincturing the vine with 1 - 2 parallel knife cuts around the stem may improve fruit set (also watch phosphorus levels and don't overfeed with nitrogen). Yield of 5-10 tonnes/ha/ annum (25 tonnes for hybrids) [9]. Fruit purple, round or ovoid with orange pulp surrounding black seeds. Let fruit fall for fullest flavour, but can be picked once purple skin colour has developed. Pick at least twice per week or daily to avoid sunburn. Skin wrinkles when fully ripe (as it loses moisture). This can be avoided by harvesting early in the morning and storing in plastic bags, or coating with a thin layer of petroleum jelly (for appearance sake only, as pulp is not affected by skin drying. The fruit stores well, especially in a cool dry place).</p>

<p>Partly frost hardy (to -2 degrees C); older vines hardier (try under eaves facing morning sun in areas subject to some frost [11]. Suitable for tropical highland to temperate (easier in warmer areas). In hot climates vine may crop all year round with peaks in late summer and late winter (cool climates have only one crop). Full sun best (young plants like a bit of shade [10]. Likes wind protection. Needs trellis, eg 2 horizontal wires. Prone to root rots in poorly-drained soils. Plant on raised beds in shallow soils. Nematodes may induce root rots. Keep woody vine butt free of weeds. Root system is shallow but extensive, so use mulch and don't cultivate near the vine. Regular water and feeding preferred for vigorous growth (vigorous plants are less subject to disease). As with most plants, a vine grown strongly in its first year will be a stronger plant.... do not let dry out, fertilise lightly. Water at flowering and fruiting optimises yields. Lack of water in spring and early summer can reduce summer crop and flowering laterals [9]. (Does survive the dry on Tablelands in my garden without watering). Poor soils quite suitable for passionfruit but liberal dressings of manure essential for commercial production. pH above 6 best, lower than 5.5 requires lime. Plant in spring to avoid frost. Seed planted in spring should fruit within 6 months [13], within 1-2 years [14]. (I have had a few fruit on very young vines). Water in well; perhaps cut or remove some leaves to reduce transpiration. The base of plants may be protected from snails with bitumen paper. Can be grown in large pot or tub.</p>

<p>Fruiting occurs on current season's growth, so it is usual to prune hard after fruiting (left unpruned, the dead wood soon masses up; pruning is also believed to improve colour and to aid disease control). Pruning dense growth for better air circulation is said to aid in the prevention the spread of fungal diseases (eg Brown spot (<i>Alternaria	passiflorae</i>), which starts as blemishes on leaves and fruit and can result in defoliation and fruit collapse; it is more prevalent in wet weather).</p>
<p>Mild climates:	prune back all laterals to about 30cm in Spring after new growth has commenced;<br>
Sub-Tropical: prune in winter with additional summer pruning (cutting back newly formed side shoots) [5]. Mature vines can be pruned with hedge shears, with some later trimming.</p>

<p>Diseases tend to be fatal. Woodiness virus or bullet (cucumber virus 1) causes mottled leaves, thickened rind and dry fruit. Fusarium wilt (a soil fungus) causes wilting of vine and rotting of stem. Potash, wood ash and compost give greater resistance; paint base of stem with bordeaux paste; spray soil with double strength garlic; before planting cover area with clear plastic for 3 weeks [11].</p>

<p>Fruit fly is usually only a minor pest (causing only skin blemishes, as do shield bugs).</p>

<p>Passionvine hopper (small moth with transparent wings) can cause leaves to wilt, fruit to shrivel
or start sooty moulds.	A single back garden vine is usually subject to fewer problems than
commercial stands - avoid monoculture.</p>

<p>Six years is considered a good long life for a vine [1], 4 years normal, commercially [2]. Grown commercially from seed produced in a disease-free area (to try and avoid woodiness virus disease). Can also propagate from 6-inch, fairly mature cutting in sand.</p>

<p>Pulp can be frozen.	Good source of Vitamins A and C, riboflavin and niacin (esp. Vit C).
Australian	production 1972-1978: 2966-3654 tonnes/annum;	80% of production in SE Qld.
Imports are 139-1039 tonnes/annum; juicing of passionfruit is expensive compared to other juices [9].</p>

Summer weed of open	forests and roadsides,	sand-dunes, wasteland.	Thin stemmed; leaves generally 3-lobed (sometimes almost heart-shaped), softly hairy, pale green, when crushed they give off an unpleasant odour. White flowers (4 cm). Unripe fruits enclosed by 3 fine lacy bracts; these drop at maturity leaving the orange-yellow (2-cm across), thin-skinned fruit exposed. Self-fertile [1]? Fruit itself is pleasant smelling. Sweet refreshing flavour. White pulp around black seed. In Java young leaves steamed and eaten with rice - bland and tender but possibly poisonous in large quantities (hydrogen cyanide). The leaves are used as a wound dressing and as an application for itching. Minor use is made of a decoction taken internally for asthma and biliousness and as an emmenagogue, but the presence of hydrogen cyanide makes internal use of green parts undesirable [8].
