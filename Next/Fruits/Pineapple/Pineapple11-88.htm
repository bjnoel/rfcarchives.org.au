<p><b>SELECTING A PINEAPPLE</b><br>
Several factors should be considered in the selection of a pineapple. Color and size are not always dependable guides.</p>
 
<p>A yellow rind is not necessarily an indication of a good ripe pineapple. Many pineapples reach the market having what dealers call a chocolate-green color, or mottled green and brown. These fruits may be in prime condition. If the crown is small and compact, the fruit is likely to be well-developed, while a pineapple with the crown as long or longer than the fruit is not likely to be of first quality. Pulling leaves from the crown is not a dependable test. The best one is to snap the side of the fruit with the thumb and finger. If the result is a hollow thud, the fruit is sour, not well-matured, and lacking in juice. If a dull, solid sound results from the snap, it indicates a well-ripened, sound fruit, full of juice. Some experiences may be necessary to distinguish between good and inferior fruit by this method, but the sound test is the most dependable guide for choosing a good pineapple.<br>

<p><b>PREPARING PINEAPPLE FAMILY STYLE</b></p>
<img src="../../FruitImages/PineA11-88.png" alt="Diagrams of the steps in peeling a pineapple">
<p>(1) Cut the sharp points from top of pineapple. Hold top firmly in left hand and, with a large, heavy knife, start peeling strips from top downward until entire rind is removed. (The top may be removed before cutting off rind).</p>

<p>(2) Remove the eyes by cutting diagonal grooves around pineapple.</p>

<p>(3) Cut off top and slice fruit lengthwise into wedges. Each serving then has some of the sweetest and most desirable portion of the fruit. The core may be removed from each slice.</p>

<p>(4) If larger pieces are desired, cut entirely through the peeled fruit lengthwise and serve the slice whole.</p>

<p><b>PREPARING PINEAPPLE LUAU STYLE </b></p>
<img src="../../FruitImages/PineB11-88.png" alt="Diagrams of a more decorative way to prepare a pineapple">
<p>(1) Cut 1&#189;-inch slices from top and bottom of an unpeeled pineapple. Save the pieces.  With a long slender knife  cut around the fruit &#189; inch inside the rind.</p>

<p>(2)  Loosen fruit at top and bottom and then push it out of rind in one piece.  Cut peeled fruit into six or eight wedge-shaped pieces.  Refill shell with spears and replace top and bottom.  Serve by removing pineapple top and taking out sections with fork or fingers.</p>

<p><b>CANNING</b><br>
Peel and cut into desired shapes. Drop into a hot medium syrup (equal measures of sugar and hot water). Cook 5 minutes. Pack into clean jars, cover with boiling syrup and seal at once. Process in a boiling water bath; quarts, 25 minutes; pints 20 minutes.</p>

<p><b>FREEZING</b><br>
Peel and cut into desired shapes. Pack into freezer cartons. Cover with cold syrup made of equal measures of sugar and water (Dissolve sugar in tap water by stirring) Then chill. It is not necessary to heat the syrup. Seal carton and freeze. Will keep 8 to 12 months.
