<p>
The delicious monstera (<i>Monstera deliciosa</i>), sometimes called ceriman, is a popular fruit throughout the warm regions of the world. Unlike most tropical fruit, it is a vine.</p>

<p>The monstera is a vigorous climbing vine that is native to Central America, primarily Mexico. It has thick stems and large, heart-shaped leaves which can be as long as 3 feet or more, and over 2 feet wide. The leaves are deeply lobed and perforated with large holes near the center. The holes appear only as the leaf matures. When grown indoors, the leaf characteristics can be very different from an outside plant.</p>

<p>Flowers appear on short thick stems several times a year, especially during the summer. They resemble huge arum lilies. The central spadix is 8 to 10 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide, and it is this that develops into the dark green, cylindrical fruit which looks somewhat like an unshucked ear of corn. The fruit takes several months to develop, sometimes 12 to 14 months.</p>

<p>The outer green covering is arranged in hexagonal plates which turn to yellow and separate as the fruit ripens. The ripening fruit exposes the soft, white edible pulp underneath. The flavor of the pulp resembles a mixture of banana and pineapple. Only small sections of the fruit will ripen each day. If you refrigerate the fruit for 24 hours and then leave it at room temperature, the fruit will ripen more evenly.</p>

<p>Eaten fresh the fruit is delicious. It can also be used in salads or in making ice cream.</p>

<p>Some monstera fruits contain high levels of calcium oxalate crystals that are extremely irritating to the throat. Only ripe fruit should be eaten and it will also help to rinse off the crystals for easier eating.</p>

<p>Monstera can be propagated by seed or cuttings. Cuttings produce fruit quicker and are more desirable in the landscape than seedlings. Vines grow rapidly under good cultivation and should be located in areas with medium to high levels of sunlight. They should be fertilized with a complete fertilizer.</p>

<p>When grown outdoors, monsteras are often allowed to grow on trees, walls or other structures that can support their weight. They can scramble on the ground, but prefer to climb.</p>

<p>A plant needs to be protected from severe cold weather and will be badly injured if temperatures drop below 28&deg;F.</p>

<p>Grown as house plants, monsteras can be mounted on tree fern plaques or cypress boards. Few however, receive high enough light levels to produce fruit. Monsteras have few pest problems and rarely, if ever, need to be sprayed.</p>

<p>There are no named varieties in the nursery trade. Individual plants may have larger fruit or fruit with fewer seeds. These plants should be cultivated and increased by vegetative propagation, so that the characteristics will not be lost.</p>

There are several monsteras with variegated foliage. One has white/green variegation while the other has yellow/cream marbling. Both produce variegated fruit with creamy yellow or white swirls. They are very attractive novelty plants and very hard to find. The fruit is just as good as the green forms.

<p>Monsteras won't tolerate poorly-drained soil. It is important to have excellent drainage, especially during the rainy season. Monstera won't tolerate excessive salt spray, so keep them well away from exposure along the waterfront.
