This plant thrives in Queensland but will even fruit in Sydney. It has no pests and diseases. To get good-sized fruit, they need fertility and moisture. They are best planted using a rooted piece from a mature plant. They do well attached to any tree or post, but in a big garden like mine, they can sprawl over the ground. Mine have spread prolifically from seed. They like shade and get scorched by hot sun. The leaves last well indoors, but don't denude your plant. In Autumn the leaves fall off and provide nourishment for the plant.</p>

<p>The fruit ripens from Christmas to April. Pick when the segments start to loosen and the fruit will break off easily or fall to the ground. Fruit can be stored in the crisper but not in a cold fridge.
You can only eat the fruit when the green segment caps fall off, so to ripen, place fruit base down in a jar with a little water at the bottom (keeps away ants), in a cool place and covered. To serve for visitors, cut fruit crosswise in 1" segments. The soft pulp is then easily removed and enjoyed.</p>

<p>Fruit which is grown in harsh conditions may have numerous black spikes interspersed with the pulp.</p>

<p>The fruits start to develop from Christmas to March inside a white arum lily-like flower. You should note hundreds of busy pollinating insects. When winter comes (even in the Tropics), growth stops. The fruit will continue to develop in early summer and be ready for eating 12 months after starting time - a fascinating growth cycle.
