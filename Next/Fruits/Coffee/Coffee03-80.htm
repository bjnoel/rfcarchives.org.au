This popular beverage is one of the most valuable agricultural exports of the tropics and is used by one-third of the world's population.</p>

<p><b>HISTORY</b><br>	
Coffee was first used in Abyssinia early in the fifteenth century. Its stimulating quality was recognised by British traders and was introduced into England in 1652. The English colonists introduced it to Ceylon about 1690, and it was not until around 1825 that coffee was planted on a commercial scale on that tropical island.</p>

<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
Coffee is now extensively grown and exported in East and West Africa, India and Ceylon, the East Indies, the West Indies, and tropical South America. The largest producer is Brazil and our nearest producer is New Guinea.</p>

<p><b>VARIETIES</b><br>
<i>Coffea arabica</i> is the best commercial variety and is responsible for most of the world's production. However, because of the "coffee leaf disease" it is mainly planted in the cooler and higher elevated parts of the tropics.</p>

<p><i>Coffea canephora</i>, also known as <i>robusta</i>, is the only other variety of commercial significance. It is a larger bush with a higher yield, but of lower quality. However, because of its resistance to coffee leaf disease, it is mainly planted in the lowlands.</p>

<p><b>DISEASES</b><br>	
Coffee leaf disease (<i>Hemileia vastatrix</i>) appears to be the only problem and affects only the Arabica variety. It is easily controlled with fungicide spray.
Shade trees are grown over the coffee bushes in the hotter areas and it is said to increase yield and maintain vigorous growth, which increases resistance to disease.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>	
Coffee is grown from seed and thrives best on deep, rich, acid soils. The plant has a strong thick tap root and a good system of radiating surface roots for feeding. Mulching, manuring and moisture are essential for good yield.</p>

<p>The seedlings should be topped from four feet back to two feet to create a spreading bush. Pruning weaker branches is done after harvest and the bush kept to about six feet high for easy harvest, which occurs in North Queensland about May.</p>
<p>
The bushes bear in the third year, reach heavy cropping in the sixth year and continue for thirty years.</p>

<p><b>LOCAL HISTORY</b><br>	
A number of coffee plantations existed between Kuranda and Mareeba in the old days, but in 1901 a severe frost wiped out all but the Streets Creek plantation. This property kept producing until about 1932, and the ground coffee was sold in local shops until about 1934. Approximately ten acres of this plantation are still thriving in a wild state on the property of Mr and Mrs. S.C. Marshall, Streets Creek, Kuranda.</p>

<p><b>PROCESSING</b><br> 
Two beans pop out of each red berry, either by hand or by pulping machine. They are then fermented in water for 12-18 hours, then dried in the sun for three weeks or in a drying machine for about three hours. The parchment, or silver skin, is then removed mechanically or by rolling on a suitable wire sieve. (In many countries this skin is now left on and is said to improve the flavour.)</p>

<p>The beans are then oven-baked to a light or dark brown colour, according to taste. The stimulating quality is due to the caffeine content.</p>

<p><b>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</b><br>	
When the Brazilian crop failed in 1976, the world market price rose to about $7,000 per ton. This prompted the planting of several acres of <i>Coffea arabica</i> in the Mareeba-Dimbula area. We wish them well in their new venture.</p>

<p><b>FOOTNOTE</b><br>
Dark red coffee beans are sweet and quite nice to eat out of hand.
