<img src="../../FruitImages/MulberryTree3-95.jpg" align="right" alt="Photo of Mulberry tree with laden branches in bags.">
One tree which is taken for granted in our orchard is the Mulberry.</p>

<p>Lately I have been looking after the Mulberry and enjoying the fruits of my labour.</p>

<p>Last September, I gathered boxes of fruit and made the fruit into jam and a refreshing mulberry drink.
The birds, especially starlings feast on the fruit and usually we only pick a handful of fruit. Last Spring, that is when the mulberry is in full fruit, I took the time to cover the fruit with bags. I acquired several onion and orange bags, cut one section out of each bottom of the bags and fastened with a peg. I slipped the bag over laden branches and then secured by tying with a string. Every second day during ripening of the fruit I held a box at the end of each covered branch, took off the peg, tapped the branch and all the ripe fruit fell into the bag. I then shook the bag till all the fruit emptied into the box.</p>

<p>It is better not to put too many mulberries to a box as they tend to squash. Squashed fruit is okay for jam though.</p>

<p>My recipe for making mulberry jam is: boil fruit for &#189; hour (no water needed) stirring occasionally. Then take off stove. Measure one cup of sugar to one cup of pulp, add 2 teaspoons of vinegar to each 1 cup of fruit plus sugar mixture.</p>

<p>Put on stove and boil and stir for &#189; hour. Put into hot, sterilised jars (the vinegar helps it to set and stops mould).</p>

<p>I also made a fresh drink with the mulberries. Place a colander over a bowl. Add mulberries and squash fruit with a jar until all juice is gone and strained into bowl. Add 50% water to juice, 5% sugar syrup, and 4% lime juice. Serve cold or freeze for later use.</p>

<p>One thing about using mulberries is that your hands turn purple. I tried everything to remove the stain. I remembered I kept an article from 1977 from "Your Garden" magazine and there it was - the answer. Use the juice of green mulberries to remove stains on hands etc. I collected some green mulberries, rubbed the juice into my hands and instantly the stains disappeared. (Nature is sure fascinating.)</p>

<p>The mulberry, according to "Your Garden" originates from Persia, now Iran. It is related to the fig and breadfruit and is of the Moraceae family.</p>

<p>For pruning, it is only necessary to thin crowded wood and cut back by half any long spindly branches.</p>

<p>Once we had a mulberry tree and cropped it back 5 ft from the ground. It died! So it is important to keep lots of leaves on the tree.</p>

<p>The mulberry is hardy, but loves to be fed with mulch and fertilizer, organic or artificial. Just a bit more attention to the mulberry can make it a very rewarding tree in your home garden.
