<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Up until a short time ago we had a great specimen of the Horseradish Tree in our herb garden. It is a perennial tree growing to about 10 metres tall. It is also deciduous. The branches and stems are brittle, the bark is corky and the leaves are pale green and feathery.</p>

<p>The flowers are fragrant, white or creamy white about 2.5 centimetres in diameter and appear in sprays.</p>

<p>The brown triangular seed pods split into 3 parts when they are dry - they usually contain about 20 seeds. Fruit is produced in March and April in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
Horseradish is widely cultivated and naturalized in tropical Africa, America, Sri Lanka, India, Mexico, Malabar, Malaysia and the Philippines. It is a native to India and Arabia.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
Propagation occurs when limb cuttings 1-2 centimetres diameter are planted. June-August is the best time. Pods appear 6-8 months after planting, but after the second year regular fruiting occurs. The tree will bear pods for several years.</p>

<p>For harvesting, the timetable suggests fruiting is best from March-April and September-October seeds are gathered and the oil expressed in March and April.</p> 

<p>It grows best in a dry sandy soil and is drought resistant.</p>

<p>Fruit flies have caused damage to the fruit and the leaves and freshly planted specimens have been attacked by weevils.</p>

<p><b>USES</b><br>
Every part of the plant has food value. Seed is eaten like a peanut in Malaya. Root used as a substitute for horseradish. Foliage is eaten in pickles, curries, salads and as a green vegetable and for seasoning. The foliage is mustard flavoured. The leaves can be formed into a compound and used as a cleanser for scrubbing utensils and cleaning walls. The small leaves sun dry in a short time and can then be stored for use in the off season.</p>

<p>Oil (Ben Oil) is used for delicate machinery e.g. watches. It is clear, sweet and odourless and it is edible (salad oil) and used in perfumes and hairdressing and as a soap. In recent times it has been superseded by sperm oil.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that it shares the same habitat as Jojoba and could therefore be used in comparison trials with this oil.</p>

<p>This tree yields seeds that clarify or purify water. According to Dr Geoff Folkard, University of Leicester, this purification process takes an hour to be safe for drinking. What opportunities can be opened up, keeping this information in mind, in developing countries such as Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>The pods, seeds and leaves are highly nutritious and contain Vitamins A and C, calcium and iron and also proteins.</p>

<p><b>MEDICINAL USES:</b><br>
<b>&#149; Internally</b><br>
&#149; tuberculosis<br>
&#149; septicaemia (bark gum)<br>
&#149; asthma<br>
&#149; gout<br>
&#149; rheumatism<br>
&#149; inflammation<br>
&#149; spleen, liver and bladder problems</p>

<p><b>Externally</b><br>
&#149; boils<br>
&#149; ulcers<br>
&#149; glandular swellings<br>
&#149; infected wounds<br>
&#149; skin diseases<br>
&#149; dental infections<br>
&#149; snake bite</p>

<p><b>Culinary</b><br>
&#149; roots make an acceptable substitute for horseradish.<br>
&#149; it is also valuable to counteract toxins in shell fish.<br>
&#149; one-half cup of cooked leaves will meet your daily recommendation for Vitamins A and C.<br>
&#149; one-half cup of pods (raw) will supply your Vitamin C quota for the day.</p>
