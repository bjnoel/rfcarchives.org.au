Eggplant and tomato plants are very susceptible to two diseases called Bacterial wilt and Fusarium wilt. Both these diseases are soil-borne, and after entering through the roots, eventually kill the plant.</p>

<p>Bacterial wilt is very common on the coast and can cause the sudden wilting and death of plants from seedling up to full bearing-size plants.</p>

<p>Fusarium wilt acts much more slowly and is fairly rare in this region.</p>

<p>Bacterial wilt can kill plants at any time of the year, but over-watering or periods of heavy rainfall will almost guarantee death from bacterial wilt.</p>

<p>A weed found locally, 'devil's fig', is resistant to bacterial and Fusarium wilt. This weed is usually found in disused grassed areas.</p>

<p>To avoid bacterial wilt in your tomato or eggplant, graft the top of your tomato or eggplant on to 'devil's fig' rootstock.</p>

<p>This is easily and simply done by using a wedge or cleft graft. The usual way is to take a devil 's fig seedling 5-10 cm high and graft the growing tip of a healthy tomato or egg plant on to it.
It should be remembered that even though the top has been grafted on to a new root system, the top is subject to all the normal pests and diseases which attack the leaves, stems, fruit and growing points of the tomato or eggplant.</p>

<p>As with all grafted plants, the graft areas must be kept above soil or mulch and well-ventilated to prevent the graft union from becoming diseased.
