<p class="in">1. Let nuts fall naturally.</p>
<p class="inn">(a) Rake from under trees, pick up and separate from leaves. Pick up at least once a week.</p>
<p class="inn">(b) Remove husks. A large pair of pliers works well.</p>
<p class="inn">(c) Spread the husked nuts in a shallow screen-bottom tray in a dry place protected from the sun for two or three weeks.</p>
<p class="in">2. Dry nuts further until shells are dry and brittle or nuts are loose in the shell and approach crispness. This can be done as follows:</p>
<p class="inn">(a) Place in a screen-bottom container over furnace register for 72 hours or more depending on nuts and amount of heat.</p>
<p class="inn">(b) OR - Place in a shallow pan in the oven at lowest temp. (about 100-115&deg;). Stir occasionally and watch that you don't cook the nuts. The warm setting on an electric oven is about right. Time required is usually about 12 hours.</p>
<p class="in">3. Store nuts in a cool place until needed. A heavy plastic bag will prevent nuts from absorbing moisture.</p>
<p class="inn">OR - Crack and store nutmeats in a tightly covered container in refrigerator or freezer.</p>
<p><b>TO HOME ROAST MACADAMIA NUTS</b></p>
<p>Nuts thoroughly dried according to the above methods are tasty and ready to eat, but some people prefer them lightly roasted as follows:</p>
<p class="in">1. Use nuts which have been thoroughly dried.</p>
<p class="in">2. Pre-heat oven to 250&deg;.</p>
<p class="in">3. Place nut meats in a shallow pan, no more than two-deep, preferably a pan with screen-bottom tray to assure good air circulation.</p>
<p class="in">4. DO NOT ROAST SMALLER WITH HALVES AND WHOLE NUTS AS THEY WILL SCORCH. Sort nuts and pieces into similar sizes and process each size separately.</p>
<p class="in">ROAST NUTS 40-50 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from oven as soon as they start to tan, as the browning process continues after removal from the oven.</p>
<p class="in">As there are variations in nuts, oven temperature regulators etc., it is best to watch closely and adjust time and temperature to meet your own conditions and tastes.</p>
<p class="in">5. Remove from heat, add a dab of butter or neutral flavor oil and sprinkle with salt. Serve hot.</p>
<p class="in">OR COOL and store in a tightly sealed jar in refrigerator or freezer.
