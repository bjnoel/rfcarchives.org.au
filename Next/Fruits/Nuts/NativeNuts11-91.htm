<p>The so called 'Hawaiian Nut', more accurately, the Queensland or macadamia nut, - is one of the most popular culinary nuts of the world. It is also the only native Australian food with widespread popularity, even though many people are still unaware that it is a native.</p>

<p>Macadamia nuts are not, however, the only edible nut native to Australia. The nuts discussed below are all native and well worthwhile cultivating for their foliage and food. While Australian Aborigines made extensive use of native produce, the white settlers and subsequent migrants have been reluctant to do so.</p>

<p>The importation of exotic species in many instances has been at the expense of native species. Bunya-bunya pines, for example, have suffered enormous damage at the hands of loggers, because of their fine timber. Nuts from this pine, however, are among the best of the native nuts and deserve to be cultivated as much as macadamias.</p>

<p>The use of native nuts, as with other native foods, need not be a replacement for exotic imported species, but an addition. We can still enjoy roasted almonds, as well as roasted bunya  bunya nuts. Cultivating and growing native species ensures their survival and expansion. The macadamia nut, for example, is assured survival because it has become popular. Unfortunately, humans seem to respond when they exploit a species, rather than letting that species exist for its own sake. The great hope of conservation is not the preservation of species for human consumption and use, but the conservation of species per se.</p>

<p>Native species are suited to native conditions, and it makes more sense to grow native species in their own habitat than to clear that habitat and try to adjust an imported species on that terrain. This, however, does not mean that any native species can be grown anywhere throughout Australia. Species that grow well in tropical rainforests, may do poorly (if at all) in cold temperate regions.</p>

<p>Cultivating native species fits in well with permaculture and any system of sustainable agriculture. Indeed, it should become an indispensable part of sustainable agricultural practices.</p>

<p>The fragile state of Australian forests cannot be overemphasised. Never pick fruit or seeds from national parks or any protected area. Native forests present us the opportunity to study the plants in their natural habitat, and as the cliche runs, "Take only photographs and leave only footprints".</p>

<p><b>MACADAMIA DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
The macadamia grows throughout Queensland and northern New South Wales. While it's not suited to cold climates, macadamias have fruited well in Melbourne.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Macadamias are highly decorative evergreen trees, with dark green, serrated-edged leaves. New growth is a beautiful reddish or light pink colour. The tree bears long white, cream or pink clusters of flowers (up to 100 flowers per cluster), followed by clusters of nuts. Two main species are grown - <i>M. integrifolia</i> and <i>M. tetraphylla</i>. <i>M. tetraphylla</i> is a more cool-tolerant variety. Care should be exercised with other species, such as<i> M. whelanii</i>, because they may be poisonous unless prepared carefully, and are best avoided altogether.</p>

<p><i>M. tetraphylla</i> is a hardy, dense large shrub or small tree, 8 to 20 m tall and 4 to 10 m wide. <i>M. integrifolia</i> is a smaller tree, growing to 15m high with a spread of 4 m. It has whorls of three non-spiny leaves and smooth-shelled nuts, while <i>M. tetraphylla</i> has whorls of four spiny leaves and rough-shelled nuts. Both attract seed-eating birds.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
Macadamias require a humus-rich and well-drained soil. They prefer warm and humid climates. In ideal positions macadamias will grow over 10 m tall. In poorer soils and colder climates they grow less vigorously. Macadamias should be planted either in full or filtered sun. They will tolerate light frost, but it is best to protect them from frost and wind, and staking young trees is advisable.</p>

<p>It is important to water macadamias very well, particularly in spring and summer. Inadequate irrigation spoils nut set and development. Mulching plays a vital role in the trees' water requirements and in weed control. Macadamias are also heavy feeders. An annual, or better still, a semi-annual application (in spring and autumn) of organic fertiliser is important. Zinc and copper deficiencies often occur and should be treated.</p>

<p>The nuts ripen from March to June. They are picked from the tree or when they fall to the ground. The hard ebony shell is difficult to crack. Nut set is improved if a cross-pollinator is available.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Macadamias propagated from seeds will usually bear after seven years, but they can take considerably longer than this. Where available, grafted varieties are preferable, because they will usually bear fruit in five years. Seedlings are readily available in some nurseries, while grafted varieties may have to be ordered from New South Wales or Queensland nurseries. Purchased specimens should be planted in early spring or early autumn. Some of the available named varieties include Nutty Glen, Own Choice, Beaumont, Renown and Marie-Louise.</p>

<p><b>PESTS</b><br>
Macadamias are prone to several pests, depending on climate and area. Nut borers and insect pests are the main problem, particularly for young establishing trees. The main pests are: macadamia cup moth (capable of defoliating the whole tree), the native macadamia felted coccid (can stunt or kill the tree), the macadamia flower caterpillar (spoils fruit set), the macadamia leafminer, the macadamia nut borer (damages trees) and the macadamia twig-girdler (stunts or kills tree). The fungal disease anthracnose can also be a problem, while <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i> (cinnamon fungus) can damage roots. The prompt removal of pests is the best strategy.</p>

<p><b>CULINARY</b><br>
Macadamia nuts are very tasty and nutritious. They have a high oil content and are packed with protein. They are excellent raw, boiled, roasted or deep fried. They are compatible with most sweets, and are delicious in curries!</p>

<p><b>PRUNING</b><br>
Young trees are trained to produce a strong single leader, up to one metre high. Pruning consists of removing any branches growing at narrow angles, thereby reducing wind damage. The aim is to encourage right-angled growth - this will usually come from shoots from the lower of the several buds borne by the tree.</p>

<h4 align="center">ARAUCARIA BIDWILII (BUNYA-BUNYA PINE)</h4>

<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
The bunya-bunya pine is found throughout the south east Queensland coastal ranges and rainforests.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
It is a large, majestic, erect, evergreen tree, 30 to 50 m tall and 10 to 20 m wide. The tree has a straight trunk with black/brown bark, and dark, glossy-green, stiff leaves, 1cm to 5cm by 0.5cm to 1 cm, ending with a sharp point. The tree bears large, dark green cones, 20cm to 30cm long, by 15cm to 20cn wide. The cones resemble green pineapples, and contain numerous seeds up to 2.5cm long.</p>

<p>The tree often looks like a giant arrowhead or domed 'beehive'. Both male and female comes are borne on a single tree but only female cones contain the edible nut. Some trees take at least ten years to set cones.</p>

<p>Cones are usually set triennially, but annual setting is aided by planting more than one tree. The cones can weigh up to 10 kg each, with each scale bearing a single egg-shaped seed. Each seed weighs 15g. Because of its importance to the Australian Aborigines' diet, it was once illegal to cut the tree. Now, unfortunately, it is logged.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
Bunya-bunya pines are cool-tolerant and very hardy trees (frost tolerant to about -8&deg;C). The trees are not suitable for home gardens because of their size and the potential health hazard when they drop their cones in autumn.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Propagation is either from seeds or cuttings.</p>

<p><b>CULINARY</b><br>
The seeds are eaten raw or roasted. They are very tasty (much like chestnuts with a slight pine flavour) and nutritious. They are packed with protein, carbohydrates, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, sodium, fibre and fat. They can be boiled and eaten hot.</p>

<h4 align="center">STERCULIA QUADRIFIDA (BUSH PEANUT TREE)</h4>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
The bush peanut tree is distributed through tropical rainforests, from northern New South Wales to the Northern Territory.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
The bush peanut tree is a medium deciduous tree, growing to 8 m high by 4 m wide. It bears handsome 5 to 8 cm long fruits, singly or in groups of two to five. The seeds of the tree are borne in summer and are black and ovoid, with each pod bearing two to five seeds, 1 cm long.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
The tree is frost and drought-tender, and requires a moist and organic rich soil. Plant in an open and sunny position. Mulch is necessary. Apply an organic fertiliser twice a year.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Propagation is by seed.</p>

<p><b>MEDICINAL</b><br>
Northern Territory and Queensland Aborigines use the tree as an anti-inflammatory agent. The leaves are used to treat insect bites, while the inner bark can be a treatment for sore eyes, and stop wounds from bleeding.</p>

<h4 align="center">ATHERTONIA DIVERSIFOLIA (BUSH ALMOND, WHITE OAK)</h4>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
This tree is common in tropical and sub-tropical Queensland (such as the Atherton Tablelands).</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
It is a bushy tree, 10 to 18m tall by 5 to 8m wide, with diverse dark green leaves, up to 20cm by 9cm. The tree bears numerous small brown flowers followed by attractive blue 3-cm-long fruits and large, flattened, sweet but woody nuts. The nuts are borne from February through to April.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
The bush almond requires cool, moist conditions in well-drained soils. It is a slow grower in the southern States and requires protection from frosts and winds.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Propagation is by seed.</p>

<h4 align="center">ELAEOCARPUS BANCROFTII 	(JOHNSON RIVER ALMOND, EBONY HEART)</h4>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
The distribution of the Johnson River almonds is in Queensland rainforests.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
It is a medium to tall evergreen tree, 15 to 30 m tall by 8 to 15 m wide, with a graceful, spreading and shady canopy. The leaves are up to 15 cm long by 6cm wide, and are dark glossy-green on the topside, and pale underneath. The tree bears while bell-shaped flowers, followed by rounded or egg-shaped green fruit with an edible kernel. The outside shell is very hard to crack. The fruit and nuts are set in March through to June, maturing in July through to October.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
It requires a well-drained soil with adequate moisture. Mulching the area around the tree is beneficial. The tree is very fast-growing (although much slower in the south), and thus needs a lot of space to grow into.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Propagation is by seed. </p>

<p><b>CULINARY</b><br>
The nut is eaten raw or cooked and has an excellent flavour</p>

<h4 align="center">TERMINALIA CATAPPA (INDIAN ALMOND, SEA ALMOND, NORTHERN BUSH ALMOND)</h4>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
The Indian almond is found along tropical seashores.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
It is a large deciduous tree, growing to 25 m high by 5 m wide. The tree bears white kernels with an excellent almond taste. Fruits are large but the nut kernel is small. The sweet purple pulp surrounding the nut is also edible. The pulp and nut are very popular in the Torres Strait Islands. The fruits grow to 6cm long.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
The tree requires a light well-drained soil, in an open and sunny position. It is drought resistant but frost tender. It should be protected when young.</p>

<p><b>PROPAGATION</b><br>
Propagation is by seed. </p>

<p><b>CULINARY</b><br>
Add them to any recipe requiring almonds, or eat them raw.</p>

<h4 align="center">ALEURITES MOLUCCANA (CANDLE NUT)</h4>
<p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b><br>
The distribution of the candle nut is in Queensland and Northern Territory rainforests.</p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
It is a large, evergreen and spreading tree, generating heavy shade, and grows from 8 to 20m high and 8 to 10m wide. The tree has large, handsome 10 to 15cm diamond-shaped, bright-green leaves and bears numerous flowers, followed by soft-shelled fruit containing one to three large nuts (5 to 8 cm). The ripe fruit is brown and falls to the ground, and the shell is hard to crack.</p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION</b><br>
The tree is quick growing, but needs protection from frost and winds in the south.</p>

<p><b>CULINARY</b><br>
Candle nuts are poisonous in a raw state. They must be roasted, and when done so are very tasty and nutritious, with a high energy content. Nevertheless, consumption of candle nuts should never be excessive, because some nuts contain cyanide. The nut has a high oil content, as much as 50 percent fat, and has a very high amount of thiamine.
