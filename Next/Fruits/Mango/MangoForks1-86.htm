<p>Mangos! The best and most versatile of all fruits. There are many different ways to savour mangos. Many a delicious common mango have I enjoyed on a sterling silver mango fork. This is a wonderful way for a child to get to know a mango (something like a toffee apple on a stick, but no toffee).</p>

<p>It is strange how few North Queenslander tropical fruit fans have never seen mango forks. I have half a dozen, still in their velvet and satin-lined box, after seventy years. My parents bought the set in early 1915 from Hardy Brothers, well known jewellers. The handles are sterling silver and the prong section E.P.N.S. The only lettering on the forks is "Hardy - made in England".</p>

<p>To use, slice off a small piece of stem end of the mango, hold firmly upright on a table, being careful not to bruise mango, push long prong of fork down directly into the middle of the seed through stem dot, until the short prongs contact sides of mango and stabilise fruit. Peel skin back as for peeling a banana, then enjoy the mango directly from the seed, bite after juicy bite! A great way to enjoy a mango, and I think some of the new varieties like carabao will be particularly delicious eaten this way.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to know where they can buy mango forks, I just don't know. I have only ever seen one other set, and that was about forty five years ago. They probably are not made anymore, but perhaps some manufacturer could revive the idea.
