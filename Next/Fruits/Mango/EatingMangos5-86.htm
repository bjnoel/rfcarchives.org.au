<i>The Editor received a very informative letter and advertising package from the Australian Marketers and Growers Corporation Pty. Ltd. of Victoria. It is so interesting, I have included all I can in the newsletter. The kit included a mango fork, pamphlets and recipes, a questionnaire and an information sheet.</i></p>

<p>Dear Jacky,<br>
I read with interest a copy of your Newsletter No.36 1/86 regarding Mango Forks (by Mrs. Brien Bosworth). I noticed you asked for more information at the foot of the article, so I have enclosed a copy of our 1985 Mango Retailer kits given to supermarket and retail outlets in Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide.</p>

<p>You will see in the kit we have included a mango fork and a questionnaire relating to its use. The forks were purchased by us in Mexico after a visit by one of our marketing people. We thought their design and use could be a novel way to improve mango consumption. Obviously, the Mexican forks are not made of sterling silver but, never the less, they were reasonably expensive after freight and a 25% import duty!! Perhaps we need to approach a local manufacturer as suggested by Mrs. Bosworth.</p>

<p>However, here lies the dilemma. Not one questionnaire was returned by retailers. Perhaps this is a reflection of a poor questionnaire or a belief by the retailers that it is not a produce accessory they wish to handle. I would suspect the latter, as the mango season is relatively short and carryover of stock in the form of mango forks would be a concern. I guess the commercial lesson is to tackle the consumer end of the market or simply give them away as a part of a major mango promotional campaign.</p>

<p>As you can see I don't have the answers but I do know where you can buy some mango forks. They aren't sterling silver!! But, they may be worth their weight in gold.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,	<br>
R. K. Vennard.<br>

<p><b>MANGO FORK - HOW TO USE</b><br>
1. Push the longer prong of the fork as far as possible into the pit(seed) of the mango at the end where the stem has been cut.<br>
2. The two small prongs are to stop the mango rotating while eating.<br>
3. Peel the skin of the mango downward from the end where the fork has been inserted.<br>
4. The mango can be eaten slicing the pulp with a knife or biting into the flesh of the mango.</p>

<p><b>HOW TO PEEL AND EAT MANGOES</b></p>
<img src="../../FruitImages/PeelingMango5-86.png" alt="Drawings of cutting a mango." align="left">
<p>MANGOES, the world's most popular fruit, have flourished in Australia since early settlement. The best mangoes are the BEAUMONT SPECIAL and SCARDALE from the premium Bowen area in Queensland.</p>

<p>Mangoes ripen from yellow green in a few days at room temperature. They are ready to eat when they yield to gentle pressure. Their outside colour should be golden yellow, flushed with a delicate pink-red tinge. They can be kept after ripening for several more days in a refrigerator.</p>

<p>Best of all, mangoes are a delicious fruit and also nutritious, providing vitamins A, C, B1 and B2 plus calcium, phosphorous and iron.
