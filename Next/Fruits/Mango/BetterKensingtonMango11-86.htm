The Department of Primary Industries has been soliciting information on good strains which might exist in Queensland and be of value for future comparative screening trials.</p>

<p>What is the true Kensington Pride Mango variety? Can we select superior strains? Can we select strains free from spongy stem end disorder? According to Mr. Brian Watson, Senior Horticulturist at the Kamerunga Horticultural Research Station, Redlynch, some of the research priorities are to characterise genetic diversity, and to identify superior strains of Kensington Pride which exist in Queensland. The superior strains would be those with smaller tree size, precocious bearing, consistently high yields, regular fruit shape, attractive skin colour, high sugar levels, good flesh texture and colour, freedom from excessive fibre, small seed size, good shelf (postharvest) life, absence of internal flesh breakdown disorders, and low susceptibility to anthracnose and bacterial black spot diseases.</p>

<p>Questions often asked about the mango are documented as follows:</p>
<p><b>SPONGY STEM END DISORDER</b><br>
The physiological condition called spongy stem end has, in recent years, become a very serious problem in Kensington Pride. Mr. Watson said it is essential that we determine whether this condition is inherited in some strains of Kensington Pride or is influenced by nutritional or other factors. At present, there have been no disease or insect problems identified as being associated with the disorder. Unfortunately, the condition sometimes encourages immature fruit to be marketed because it is particularly evident in tree-ripened fruit.</p>

<p><b>HISTORY OF KENSINGTON PRIDE</b><br>
It is now over 100 years since the original Kensington Pride mango was imported into Queensland as seed from India and subsequently established and selected at Bowen. The variety is variously known as Kensington, Kensington Pride, Bowen, Bowen Special, and Peach, but Kensington Pride or Kensington is the preferred name. However, Kensington is not a group of sub-varieties or clones. Although most seedlings come true-to-type from seed, there is a percentage of fertilized embryos which have given rise to variants - some good and others with poor characteristics. Many growers have made a point of selecting better types.</p>
<p>On the other hand, use of damaged and rejected fruit (misshapen, internal breakdown) by nursery  men who obtain seed from processors and farmers can invariably lead only to the multiplication of undesirable types.</p>

<p><b>CONSISTENT PRODUCT QUALITY</b><br>
Whilst propagation of selected Kensington Pride clones by grafting would assist greatly in providing a consistent product, it is not fair to suggest that the current industry is not substantially based on good types. However, trees in much of the area recently planted in North Queensland could be of much more variable nature. In order to provide a product which is consistently good on Australian and overseas markets, grafting of trees or rigorous seed selection is probably essential for future development. From grafted trees we can also expect some benefits in earlier bearing and slower growing trees which are easier to harvest.</p>

<p><b>OTHER VARIETIES</b><br>
The Queensland Department of Primary Industries has supported an extensive programme of introducing overseas cultivars, particularly over the past ten years. Although few have been recommended and released for commercial planting, the programme is necessary to extend the harvesting season, increase export market potential and increase disease resistance. Whilst the screening programme will continue, it is likely that the rate of introduction of new cultivars will slow down considerably in the years ahead.</p>

<p><b>FUTURE OF KENSINGTON SELECTION PROGRAMMES</b><br>
Whilst our overall knowledge of the diversity in Kensington Pride is limited, it is regarded as the benchmark for comparing overseas introductions and local selections. In it we have a really excellent mango. However, there is potential for improvement in terms of overall fruit quality. Such improvement would help meet export standards. In addition, the possibilities of selecting away from spongy stem end disorder, bacterial black spot and other, as yet unintroduced pests and diseases, are apparent, although as yet cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>The QDPI would like to hear from commercial producers and home gardeners who have Kensington trees with the desired characteristics and most importantly, the consistent absence of the spongy stem end disorder over a period of at least five years. Contact can be made through the author or the nearest QDPI horticulture officer throughout the State.
