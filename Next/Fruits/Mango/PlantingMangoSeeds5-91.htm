<p>
Seed should be fresh - I have found that seed coming from fallen fruit is mostly viable if collected while at least some orange-coloured flesh is still present. In seeds older than this, the kernel has often started to blacken and germination is poor. I have also planted seed from windfall fruit about three-quarters mature with good success.</p>

<p>Seed can be dried in a well-ventilated position (not in full sun) for a few days after cleaning flesh off. This makes it easier to handle seed for dehusking. Do not keep longer than 1 week after drying or kernel will start to dry or go black.</p> 

<p>Using a sharp knife, cut open edge of husk and remove kernel -  this seam of husk is generally easier than other side. Remove weevils and damage and then plant - rounded side up.</p>

<p><b>POLYEMBRYONIC SEEDS</b> will produce multiple plants and can be densely planted in seed beds to be divided up later. I use polystyrene produce boxes (they have drainage holes already in them), and plant the seeds convex side up about 4 cm apart. I use my potting mix and just cover seeds.</p>

<p>Germination takes 2 - 3 weeks. Dividing and potting-on can be done any time after first flush has hardened off. I usually do mine in April. During extended wet weather, fungus may be a problem in dense seedlings - spray with dithane or similar.</p>

<p><b>MONO EMBRYONIC SEEDS</b> can be planted in pots as they will only produce one plant. These will need to be grafted - not true to type.</p>

<p><b>R2E2 MANGO RIPENING TIMES</b> - 1991 - Yeppoon area.</p>
<p>This year our 3-year-old R2E2 mango trees produced about 100 fruit. To determine the ripening times, they were left on the tree until they showed a trace of yellow at the bottom end, and were then picked. They were left on a a shaded, well-ventilated bench to ripen, which took about 5 - 7 days.</p> 

<p>R2E2 mangoes should be eaten when 95% plus of the green skin has changed colour to yellow. At room temperature, they will remain edible for about 4 days, and then will start to develop that over-ripe flavour. They remain 'very firm' during this time - do not leave until they go 'softer' unless you like it that way.</p>

<p>According to D.P.I. information, mangoes can be stored at no lower than 13&deg;C for about 2 weeks or so. Best ripening temperature is about 20&deg;C.</p>

<p>The first fruit were picked during the last week in January, the last during the first week in March, with peak harvest about mid-February. This roughly coincided with the end of Kensington Pride harvest and the start of the Keitt harvest.
