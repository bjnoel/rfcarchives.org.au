A large variety of mangos are available for growing in Australia and more are becoming available. The Rare Fruit Council Fact Sheet No.11 - Mango Varieties - depicts 22 varieties. One of those depicted is the R2 E2. In correspondence with Noel Meurant - District Adviser in Bowen with the Horticultural Branch of the Queensland Department Primary Industries, Noel has outlined various aspects of R2 E2.
R2 E2 is the current name given to a new mango cultivar bred by the Department of Primary Industries at the Bowen Horticultural Research Station.</p>

<p>No other introduced or locally-selected cultivar in the last fifty years has drawn more commercial interest than this mango. It was selected from a number of seedlings grown from the introduced cultivar, Kent, planted at the Research Station in 1978.</p>

<p>Kent seed is monoembryonic, that is, it does not breed true to type as do Kensingtons and 'commons'. Consequently, all the seedlings grown from this cultivar were extremely variable. The seedling which eventually produced the most desirable fruit type was selected, and so far has retained the code name R2 E2.</p>

<p>Detailed research work is still proceeding on the performance and other agronomic characteristics of this cultivar, but it does appear to have characteristics which will complement our dominant cultivar, Kensington, and has some features which are superior.</p>

<p>An unusual feature of R2 E2 is the type of seed produced from this selection: both monoembryonic seed which produces a single seedling which generally is different from the parent; and polyembryonic seed (as with Kensington and Common) which commonly produce up to 5 or more seedlings which, most often, are the same as the parent tree. For this reason, growers wishing to grow this cultivar should use grafted plants to ensure trueness to type.</p>

<p>Many trees of this selection have been planted both experimentally and commercially  throughout Queensland and the Northern Territory, but the largest commercial orchards have been established in the drier areas between Townsville and Rockhampton.</p>

<p>The flowers of R2 E2 are a little shorter and stubbier than those of Kensington and contain more darker pink colouring than the paler pink of Kensington.</p>

<p>R2 E2 produces large, to very large, fruit averaging about 800 grams in weight, with many exceeding one kilogram. Fruit from Kensington would be about half this size.</p>

<p>The external colour of R2 E2 is yellow-green with an orange-red blush similar to Kensington. The skin is thick, overlying very firm lemon-green flesh which is medium to smooth in texture when ripe.</p>

<p>The flesh fibre is medium to low, and the seed is small in comparison to the depth of flesh, resulting in a high flesh-recovery ratio. On average, R2 E2 has a 77% flesh-recovery ratio compared to 63% for Kensington.</p>

<p>The flavour of R2 E2 is more bland than Kensington but is quite pleasant. Overripe fruit, however, may acquire a slight pineapple taste.</p>

<p>The mid-point of cropping of R2 E2 is two to three weeks later than that of Kensington.</p>

<p>Concise data has not been recorded on the disease susceptibility of R2 E2 but, whilst it has been shown to be susceptible to bacterial black spot, it appears to be less so than its parent, Kent.</p>

<p>Anthracnose has been observed on the fruit and foliage, but its susceptibility status is not recorded.</p>

<p>No internal breakdown problems have been found in R2 E2, and when the fruit is mature, stem-end sap is minimal.</p>

<p>Observations have shown R2 E2 has an excellent shelf-life, and this factor should be of immense value for long distance transport or for storage whilst awaiting processing.</p>

<p>R2 E2 does appear to have a promising commercial future on the fresh fruit market, and probably more so in the processing industry. Fruit, so far consigned to the fresh market, has met a very keen demand and returned much higher prices than that of any other cultivars.</p>

<p>However, some reservations must be expressed on the current situation as some market 'backlash' may occur because of the dominance of large-size fruit once heavier quantities are received in the future.</p>

<p>Indications are that R2 E2 could have an excellent future in the processing industry. Its large size would be advantageous; its high flesh-recovery ratio should prove very economic; and the firmness of the flesh is most desirable, particularIy for the lucrative frozen, sliced or chip trade.
