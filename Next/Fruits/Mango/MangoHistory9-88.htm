The mango has been cultivated for about 4,000 years. Its prominence in Hindu mythology leaves no doubt as to its antiquity. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, with relatives such as the cashew and pistachio nut.</p>

<p>The name 'mango' is derived from the Portuguese 'manga'. Tamil name 'man-key' or 'man-gay' is the original of the word, the Portuguese having formed 'manga' from this when they settled in western India.</p>

<p>The mango appears to be indigenous to the tropical Himalayan region. In many regions, it is difficult to say whether such a common tree is wild or not.</p>

<p>The Chinese traveller, Hwen T'sang, who visited Hindustan between 632 and 645 A.D., was the first person to bring the mango to the attention of the outside world. The Portuguese are given the credit for bringing the mango to America. It was introduced to Brazil around 1700. Captain Cook found the fruit in great abundance in Rio de Janeiro and Madeira in 1768. It was introduced to the West Indies in 1742.</p>

<p>Mangoes were first introduced to Queensland by J.C. Bidwell at the end of the 1840s. Plants were sent from the Sydney Botanic Gardens in 1854 to M.C. O'Connell at Port Curtis and to a garden in Brisbane. The Brisbane Botanic Gardens had a mango tree in 1861, which fruited in 1867.</p>

<p>The varieties Alphonse and Raspberry were introduced from Bombay by the Acclimatisation Society in 1869. Kensington Pride is believed to be of Indian origin and was first grown at Adelaide Point near Bowen between 1864 and 1888.</p>

<p>Numerous varieties have been introduced since 1960 for trials at various research stations. Introductions have been made from India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Florida, West Indies, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia.
