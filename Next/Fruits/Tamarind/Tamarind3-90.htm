Worcestershire sauce is a noble sauce, not a common condiment. According to the label of the THE ORIGINAL AND GENUINE sauce of Worcestershire, it is a product based on the recipe of a nobleman of the county.</p>

<p>Tom Jones, not the singer, in a moment of gourmet wisdom or romantic folly, exchanged this sauce of sauces for a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>In the days when eggs were safe, I used to add a little zip to fried eggs with Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco.</p>

<p>Back to reading the bottle. One of the named ingredients of Worcestershire sauce is the fruit of the tamarind tree. This is a tree of the bean family or Leguminosae, and the fruit is a pod containing sticky brown pulp and a number of seeds. The pulp with its sweet and sour taste is a flavoring in the sauce and also can be found in many dishes of the Far East.</p>

<p>The pulp, if steeped in water and then strained, makes a refreshing and nutritious drink.</p>

<p>The medicinal reputation of the fruit is prodigious. It is valued as a refrigerant, digestive carminative, laxative and antiscorbutic. This means it will have a cooling effect on your skin; and if you have a stomach for it, your bowels will be wowed, moved and calmed. And you will be protected against scurvy.</p>

<p>An infusion of pulp in seawater is good for cleaning silverware and pickling fish.</p>

<p>The seed is another useful item and has been used to make jelly, varnish and wood cement. The leaves can be used to make a yellow dye and act as a poultice for boils.</p>

<p>What else? The tamarind is a superb tree. In South Florida it grows to about 50 feet and usually has a very attractive dome shape. The tree will tackle our poorest soils and is salt and hurricane resistant.</p>

<p>It can be recommended for its shade, strength and fruit. Once established, it is virtually maintenance free, except for some fertilizer to speed growth.
