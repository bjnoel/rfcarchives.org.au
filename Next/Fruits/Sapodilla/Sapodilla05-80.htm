The Sapodilla (<i>Achras sapote</i>) which is native to Mexico is now grown extensively throughout many tropical regions around the world.</p>

<p>We've found the fruit in Mexico, Indonesia and the Philippines; in all three places, the fruits were of good quality. The fruit grows to three or four inches in diameter, round with a soft, brown, fuzzy skin; inside the flesh is also a brown colour, very juicy and refreshing. It's texture is similar to that of a pear, and the Sapodilla tastes very sweet. The fruit must be eaten only when fully ripe, like the Star Apple, or else it has an unpleasant sap in the flesh, but the Sapodilla can be picked slightly green and shipped quite easily, although the best flavour is obtained when they are tree-ripened.</p>

<p>The Sapodilla is one of the slower trees to bear, taking seven to ten years. Good growth can be encouraged with lots of water and manure two or three times per year. Once established, the tree is hardy and will grow in a wide range of soils. It is a shapely tree, round, and can grow to 60 feet in height in hot, humid, coastal climates. Sapodillas are quite tolerant of different climates and will withstand frosts when mature.</p>

<p>This makes the Sapodilla a good choice for Australia, providing an excellent fruit that can be produced in our various climates in Queensland.
