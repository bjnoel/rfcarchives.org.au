					GUAVA JAM

<p><b>Method:</b><br> 
Cut guavas in half, place in large pot and cover with water. Boil until the fruit is soft. Strain through muslin or similar fine cloth. Allow to drip for several hours.</p> 

<p>Measure out 4 cups of the guava juice and place in a large, deep microwave safe pot. Add 4 cups of sugar and cup of lemon or lime juice and stir. Place in microwave and heat on high for 5 minutes. Stir again. Heat again on high for a further 3-5 minutes. Stir again.</p> 

<p>The sugar should be dissolved by now. If not, keep heating and stirring a few minutes at a time until it is. </p>

<p>When the sugar is dissolved, cook on high for 20 minutes. After that, stir and check for set. It will probably take another twenty minutes but should be checked regularly from this stage.</p>

 <p>I tend to check every five to ten minutes depending on how I think it is going. When it is setting adequately, bottle in hot, sterilised jars.</p>

<p><b>Fine points:</b><br>
When I boil up the fruit, I juice the lemons or limes first and put the skins in with the guavas to boil. I think it helps with the set. I prefer to use limes when I can as I prefer the flavour. Be very careful to not over-cook it at the end as burnt jam can happen quite quickly. Don't be tempted to cook up bigger quantities at once - it doesn't work. The juice from the guavas can be kept in the fridge for a few days or in the freezer for months.
