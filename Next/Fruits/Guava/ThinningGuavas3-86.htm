A few years ago I wondered if thinning strawberry guavas would increase their size. I thinned heavily on some branches, not on others. At harvest, there was no apparent difference in size between the fruit on thinned and unthinned branches.</p>

<p>This year the same tree set an exceptionally heavy crop of fruit. Immediately next to it was a red strawberry guava which set a normal crop. The branches of the yellow strawberry guava started drooping from fruit weight, so I thinned some, but not enough! One day I noted the tree was virtually defoliated on many branches. The red strawberry guava next to it showed no sign of duress. I rapidly thinned what remained of the guava crop, and am pleased to report that the tree has started to recover.</p>

<p>So here's a new 'rule of thumb' for the year of the guava: if you can touch two guavas with your thumb, they're too close (I favour the metric thumb).</p>

<p>Different size and types of fruit, different cultivars of a species, and different stages in the life of a fruit tree may require different rules. It is well to keep in mind, as I had not, that thinning is desirable for many purposes other than to increase the size of the individual fruit.
