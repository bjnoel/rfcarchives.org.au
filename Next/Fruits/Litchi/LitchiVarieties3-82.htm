Before leaving for Sri Lanka, Keith Chapman of D.P.I. Nambour, was kind enough to answer a brief questionnaire on lychees. It is only a temporary form, as Keith is preparing a paper on lychees, but it is not ready to go to print just yet.  We are looking forward to the release of this report.</p>

<p>Q.   What treatment prolongs shelf-life?<br>
A.	Cool storage and/or hot benlate dip (1g/l) 52&deg;C for 2 minutes, then pvc film wrap.</p>
