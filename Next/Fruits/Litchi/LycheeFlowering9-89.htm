It is well known (though not necessarily recommended) that some trees will flower when stressed. Stress may be caused through cincturing or a prolonged dry period. About eight years ago I noticed that a young Tai So Lychee tree burst into flowers when I terminated that poor tree's lengthy drought in October! In the tropical parts of North Queensland, the Tai So is not the most regular-flowering variety, and trees under ten years old are particularly unreliable. It is understood that a dry period after the wet season, and a cold, but frost-free winter promote flowering in this variety. This is assuming that other factors, such as the tree's age and vigour are satisfactory.</p>

<p>Townsville frequently has insufficiently cold nights during the early winter months, although the dry period is very reliable. Some six years ago, our region received an un-seasonal 25mm of rain on the first of July. Two weeks later, my seven-year-old lychee tree was obviously forming flower stalks. I have helped nature ever since, by providing that 'inch' of water, and was rewarded with flowers in return.</p>

<p>The date makes sense; many trees form two chemicals according to day-length. Soon after the longest night (23rd of June), the balance of the chemicals is changed, and flowering is initiated if certain other conditions are suitable. It seems that in the case of the Tai So, a heavy watering after a drought is as effective as a cold winter. The observation that watering the Tai So at that time is crucial, is simple. It may not have become evident many years earlier, because further south, the cold winters prevail, whereas the lychee-growing districts further north are much wetter than Townsville's. In the Cairns region, a helping sprinkling, to initiate flowering is less frequently needed. In fact, in warm and wet districts, it appears, rain in May and June has spoiled the Tai So's reputation.</p>

<p>I have checked the efficacy of timely watering in various ways. A neighbour worried that his lychee forgot to flower by late July. Through a sprinkling, the tree was given a reminder, and it burst belatedly into blossoms. A local lychee grower tried the 'water treatment', and his Tai So trees, over a third of his orchard of about 300 trees, responded in unison. The response of the other two varieties was varied and unreliable.
