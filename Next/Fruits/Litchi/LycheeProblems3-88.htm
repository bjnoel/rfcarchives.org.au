Having just tasted my first 'tree ripened' lychee for the season, I am reminded why this fruit is so famous - why 1 billion Chinese regard it as the BEST; that delicious, delicate flavour, that pleasant balance of acid and sweet. It is easy to see why this fruit was the choice of so many emperors.</p>

<p>The lychee industry in Australia is currently suffering from a few problems and I would like to comment on these.</p>

<p><b>LOW MARKET PRICES</b><br>
Every year, almost without exception, the first lychee fruit on the market are of poor quality and immature, and usually sell for about $3.50 a kg. This low initial price has a dampening effect on prices for the rest of the season. As quality improves later in the season, prices rise to about $7 or $8 but compare this with $14.90 for imported lychees from Taiwan.</p>

<p>It would appear some growers panic when they see the first signs of parrot or flying fox damage, and pick the whole crop regardless of maturity. The threat of hail damage has also been blamed for premature harvesting.  Whatever the cause, this practice has got to stop. Bird nets or hail nets are the best and cheapest answer to this problem. They are easy to place over a tree using two long light poles, and they more than pay for themselves in the first season.</p>

<p><b>BIENNIAL OR IRREGULAR CROPPING</b><br>
This is a common problem in all lychee-growing countries. The species is reasonably particular in its climatic requirements. Early to mid-season varieties perform best in the northern half of Queensland while mid to late-season lychees are more suited to Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales. The only exception that I would recommend is the variety BENGAL, which bears a tremendous crop every second year. The fruit are large with good colour and taste. The large seed appears to be only a 'claytons complaint'.</p>

<p>Growers should seek out trees which are known to fruit well in their particular area and include some in their plantings. Naturally, the trees chosen should have good marketing qualities of colour, size and taste.</p>
<p>Good fertilizer programmes are also essential for regular bearing. Correct fertilizing is a skill usually learnt the hard way. The easy way is to follow other successful growers.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT DROP</b><br>
Most physiological fruit drop occurs in the first three weeks after fruit set. High levels of fruit drop after this period appear to be mostly caused by insect damage, in particular the fruit spotting bug, <i>Amblypelta nitida</i>.</p>

<p>Dry soil also takes its toll of immature fruit.</p>

<p><b>FRUIT QUALITY AND PRICE</b><br>
Fruit should not be 'rough handled' at any stage. Careful grading improves market prices.
Attractive packaging is another price lifter.</p>
<p>To retain good skin colour and quality, it is essential to dip lychees in hot BENOMIL and later sealed with PVC film. Details of this treatment are available from the Queensland Department of Primary Industries.</p>

<p>Buyers employed by supermarkets and grocery chains appear to need educating in quality standards. Perhaps a circular explaining the advantages of stocking good quality fruit could be sent to them before each lychee season.</p>

<p>Poor quality and immature fruit, particularly when they are marketed early in the season, are ruining the lychee reputation and price for the rest of the season. It would appear promotion and education are lagging behind production.
