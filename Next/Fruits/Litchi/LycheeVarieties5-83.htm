<b>Naming system</b><br>
The naming system in this farmnote has been developed to provide a simple set of names which can be pronounced by Australians yet are based on the original Chinese names. This is a practical system suitable for adoption by horticultural advisers, growers, nurserymen and home gardeners.</p>

<p>The system has been endorsed by the Plant Production Committee of the Standing Committee on Agriculture on which all State Departments of Agriculture and CSIRO are represented.</p>

<p><b>Standardized spelling</b><br>
Some problems arose in deciding on standardized names for varieties of Chinese origin.
The Cantonese names are most familiar to Australians and indeed most Chinese outside northern China.
However, Cantonese has no official status as a language in China because Mandarin ('putonghua') is the official national language.</p>

<p>An officially-endorsed system of writing Mandarin in the Roman alphabet is available - this system is known as 'Pinyin' which is now familiar to Australians in the revised names of Peking (Beijing) and Canton (Guangzhou) - but no such system now exists for Cantonese.</p>

<p>However, it was decided to stay with the Cantonese names because lychee growers and nurserymen are already familiar with many of these names and it is difficult to pronounce the Pinyin (Mandarin) names without training because of the peculiar phonetic system of Pinyin and the complex and unfamiliar tonal variations required.</p>

<p>With the help of several Cantonese-speaking people, a set of spellings was devised which results in a reasonable pronunciation when read by unbriefed Australians (see column headed "recommended name" in Tables 1 and 2)</p>
<p>The Pinyin names will be useful for cross-referencing to Chinese literature and correspondence with Chinese lychee experts (fourth column of Table 1 and third column of Table 2).</p>

<p>*Some of these names have been used for separate importations of the variety into Australia and the names can be retained to identify these separate lines as strains. The variety and strains are written in the form: 'Tai So' - Mauritius strain.<br>
+ Including known Australian sources of the varieties.<br>
#	The pink strain is considered to be standard in China although the red form is possibly more common. The pink strain is characterised as the 'duck head green' Kwai May. The 'duck head green' refers to the dark green or black tubercle tips near the fruit stalk.<br>
** Tentative identification only.<br>
Recent evaluation (Jan 1983) indicates that:<br>
1.  Some Haak Yip selections may in fact be Souey Tung.<br>
2.  Nearly all older introductions of No Mai Chee (standard) may in fact be Kwai May Red.</p>

+ The synonym 'Dian bai bai la' (Pinyin) distinguishes this variety from a different variety grown around Guangzhou (Canton) which is also known as 'Bah Lup'. This latter 'Bah Lup' was originally called 'Bah Lup Zee; (Bai la zi - Pinyin) and is best distinguished as such.<br>

However, there may be some variation under Queensland conditions.</p>
<p>The complete set of varieties should give a harvest period of 9 to 11 weeks at one location. 
 However, not all districts have climatic suitability for the full range.</p>
<p>As a broad rule of thumb, early season varieties are more suited for warm areas whilst mid-to-late season varieties perform best in cooler areas (south Queensland/northern New South Wales.</p>

<tr><th>VARIETY</th><th>ORIGIN</th><th>COMMENTS</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bengal</td><td>Florida</td><td>A seedling selection. Parent tree probably 'Purbi' in West Bengal (India). Fruit heart-shaped; seed pointed; leaflet wavy. Often wrongly called	
'Brewster' In Australia. Reasonable bearer but quality ordinary, Bengal has also been called Bedana (incorrectly).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brewster</td><td>Florida</td><td>Claimed by some to be Chen zi (Chen family purple) from Fukien, China, but does not fit a recent description of Chen zi. Fruit and seed oblong, bright red. Tree vigorous with wide, strong, reinforced branch crotches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Groff</td><td>Hawaii</td><td>A Haak Yip seedling selection. Bears in Hawaii where other varieties fail due to poor flower initiation. Leaflet tapering, flat, very wavy.	</td></tr>
<tr><td>Muzaffarpur</td><td>India</td><td>Also known as 'Shahi' and 'Late Large Red' in India. Very important cultivar in Bihar and West Bengal.	Fruit large, oblong: seed large, blunt, oblong.	</td></tr>

<p><b>Other Lychee varieties</b><br>Several other varieties have been imported from Hong Kong, Thailand, India, South Africa and the United States of America. Some of the Thai varieties appear to be renamed Chinese varieties (see Table 1).</p>

<p>The varieties Mauritius and H. L. H. Mauritius from South Africa, Maw Mong and Hong Huey from Thailand, and Charley Tong from Hawaii are very similar to or identical with Tai So (see Table 1).</p>

<p>These names may be retained as names for 'strains' within the Tai So 'group' until proven identical with Tai So. They should be written as (for example): 'Tai So' - Mauritius strain.</p>

<p>Other varieties which have been imported through Kamerunga Horticultural Research Station over the last five years are:<br>
Amboina (originally from Indonesia?)<br> 
Peerless (ex Florida)<br>
Cheng<br>
Erewhon<br>
Hong Thai<br>
Jim Jee<br>
Kaloke Bai Yaow<br> 
Kom<br>
Kom Hom Lam Chiak<br> 
Luk Lai<br>
Sampao Kaow (all from Thailand).</p> 

<p>Some of these varieties may in fact be renamed Chinese varieties.</p>

<p>There has been some confusion over 'Brewster' and 'Bengal' in Australia. The variety common in the nursery trade is 'Bengal'.</p>

<p>In contrast to 'Brewster', 'Bengal' has wavy leaflets and the seed of 'Bengal' is distinctly pointed (see Table 3).</p>

<p>The true 'Brewster' rarely exists outside of arboreta at present, and is not likely to become important because of its poor bearing behaviour. However, it has not been adequately evaluated, particularly in colder areas where It may perform well.</p>

<p>The name 'Bedana' formerly given to 'Bengal' is also an incorrect identification.
