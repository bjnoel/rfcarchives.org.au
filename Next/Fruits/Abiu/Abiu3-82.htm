In the 1950s the Sub Tropical Experiment Station, currently renamed the 'Agricultural Research and Education Center') distributed plants of the abiu (<i>Pouteria caimito</i>). These seedlings were grown and fruited by Seymour Younghans,  the writer and the Experiment Station. Unfortunately the fruit was small with most of the pulp area occupied by seeds; however, the flavor was good.</p>

<p>In 1969 the writer visited Iquitos, Peru where he encountered superior strains of excellent quality 4 inch  diameter fruit with only three seeds. Subsequent plant collecting trips to this area by other R.F.C. members has uncovered even larger fruit of similar quality with diameters of 5 inches. These Amazon abiu varieties are presently being grown by a number of R. F. C. members, the writers tree being the first to fruit.</p>

<p>The abiu can be propagated from seed. graft or marcot. The young plant should be protected in windy locations and unsuitable soils, such as marl or high pH beach-type sands avoided. Flowering may take place over a span of several years or more prior to when the first fruit set occurs, which ripens from July thru October in Florida. Its flavor somewhat resembles the star apple (<i>Chrysophyllum cainito</i>).
