<p>

The carambola is sometimes called a five-corner or five-finger fruit. At odd times I have seen fruit on my tree with 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 corners, but most of the time they have 5 corners. The tree that I have fruiting is a B6 variety. </p><p>For the first 2 to 3 years the tree grew very fast. It is an evergreen tree and always has attractive glossy foliage on it. Although the tree originates from Malaysia and Indonesia you could be forgiven for thinking that is was native to Mackay, Queensland, as the tree grows so well and fruits so prolifically in this area.</p><p>I have found that the fruit of the B6 variety can be eaten when they are over 50% green coloured and taste acceptable. When they are completely orange or yellow, to me they taste too sweet. The fruit can be used in many different ways - starting in the orchard, it can be eaten on the spot straight off the tree. Some other uses are in fruit salad as star-shaped slices; flavouring in ice cream; drying as star-shaped slices, or leather. Blend and add to fruit juices. Makes 'yummy' jelly similar to guava jelly. </p>

<p>So far, I have had no pests or diseases attack the tree. The main pest that attacks the fruit is fruit fly. I control them by spraying with Lebaycid. Some fruit is also damaged by fruit sucking moths.</p> 

<p>The tree has more than one crop per year with some of the crops being very heavy. This tree receives very little attention, yet always looks good and fruits well. I believe that this fruit in the Mackay area has great commercial potential.
