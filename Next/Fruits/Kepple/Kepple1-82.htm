This very rare member of the Annona family is steeped in Indonesian tradition. Its main claim to fame is that when eaten in some quantity, one's bodily excretions become highly perfumed, similar to the fragrance of violets.</p>

<p>In some areas of Java and Sumatra, only the Sultan is allowed to grow the fruit and of course, the ladies of his harem were encouraged to eat large quantities.</p>

<p>Two conflicting stories have emerged from R.F.C. members, who have found Kepple fruit on their Indonesian tours. One is that the fruit acts as a contraceptive in the harems; the other is that women who eat the fruit bear beautiful children. The reason for the latter, in folklore, is that the fruit cleanses the kidneys and other organs, (Dr. Kloppenburg)</p>

<p>It seems that R.F.C. members will have to draw their own conclusions, or as they say, "pay your money and take your chances".</p>
