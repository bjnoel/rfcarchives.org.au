The botantical name for this is <i>Antidesma dallachyanum</i>. It comes from the family Euphorbiaceae. It is mainly used in jams, jellies, drinks and desserts.</p>

<p>A more well-known related species is the Herbert River Cherry. It grows throughout the coastal regions of Queensland, growing on the edges of rainforests and creeks.</p>

<p>The plant is more weeping than upright. It is densely foliaged and grows about 8 metres in height. The leaves are slightly softer and not shiny.</p>

<p>The fruits are among the largest of the Antidesma family. The flowering time is December, with the fruits ripening in February/March. Again, two trees are needed, one flowering female, the other flowering male.</p>

<p>The fruits are 1cm in diameter, bunched in racemes 7cm long. The fruits colour from green through to shades of pink to dark red. They are best used when slightly 'green', that is when bright red, not deep black-red. The juice can be made and used like the bignay. It also makes a very tasty jam.
